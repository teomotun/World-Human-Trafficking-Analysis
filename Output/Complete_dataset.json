The government demonstrated increasing efforts compared to the previous reporting period; therefore Afghanistan remained on Tier 2. The government demonstrated increasing efforts by enacting a revised penal code that raised the penalties for human trafficking crimes and criminalized additional activities relating to bacha bazi, a practice in which men exploit boys for social and sexual entertainment. The government identified more trafficking victims and partnered with an international organization to draft and finalize a training manual for combating trafficking, including procedures on victim identification and referral. The government enacted a policy for the Afghan National Army that prohibited child recruitment and established procedures for the demobilization and care of children involved in armed conftict. The government also opened an additional child protection unit to prevent the recruitment of children into the security forces and proactively prevented the recruitment of 79 children from April through June 2017. However, the government did not meet the minimum standards in several key areas. Despite credible allegations of official complicity, especially in the sexual exploitation, unlawful recruitment, and use of children by Afghan security forces, the government did not report any newly initiated prosecutions or convictions of officials complicit in human trafficking. District and provincial-level officials continued to conftate trafficking and smuggling, and many officials were unable to identify trafficking victims, which resulted in the government's arrest and prosecution of some trafficking victims as criminals. Victim protection efforts were overall insufficient, as the government did not employ standard victim identification protocols during the reporting period, and the one government-owned short-term trafficking shelter closed when donor funding was not renewed.

In August 2017, the high commission became an autonomous government office under the Ministry of Justice; most of the office's staff worked on trafficking among other human rights issues. The broader high commission of 12 ministries and offices met three times in 2017, although not all ministries attended the meetings. A working-level technical committee held eight meetings in 2017 and partnered directly with international organizations and NGOs to implement the commission's policies. Provincial anti-trafficking commissions in 33 provinces coordinated activities to implement policy established by the high commission; however, the high commission reported only 16 were active during the reporting year. The government continued to implement its national action plan scheduled to end in April 2018. The high commission, in partnership with an international organization, drafted its first national report to comprehensively review trends, laws, and societal views on human trafficking; the technical committee supported the research but was unable to compel other ministries to capture and share statistics on trafficking. The high commission, in partnership with international organizations and NGOs, increased its public awareness programs from 22 during the previous reporting period to 210 in 2017, reaching approximately 16,500 members of the public. The government also continued to encourage mullahs to raise awareness through their weekly sermons. In December 2017, the MOD enacted the Protection of Children in Armed Conftict Policy for the Afghan National Army, which defined the rights of children, prohibited child recruitment, and established procedures for monitoring and enforcement, reporting violations, and rescuing and caring for children involved in armed conftict. In September 2017, MOI opened a child protection unit (CPU), bringing the total to 22 CPUs throughout the country to prevent the recruitment of children into the security forces. According to an international organization, the CPUs prevented the recruitment of 79 children from April through June 2017. The government continued to develop plans for its long-delayed electronic national identification card. The government utilized a policy and action plan for the reintegration of Afghan returnees and internally displaced persons in partnership with the UN; however, the government's ability to assist vulnerable persons, including over 600,000 documented and undocumented returnees from Pakistan and Iran in 2017, remained limited, and it continued to rely on the international community for assistance. The government did not take steps to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts or forced labor. ","prosecution":"The government increased its overall law enforcement efforts but did not report any efforts to prosecute or convict allegedly complicit officials, and overall trafficking investigations, prosecutions, and convictions remained low for the scale of the problem. The 2017 Law to Combat Crimes of Trafficking in Persons and Smuggling of Migrants criminalized sex and labor trafficking, including bacha bazi, a practice in which men exploit boys for social and sexual entertainment. The law prescribed penalties between five and eight years imprisonment; aggravating factors increased the maximum sentence to between 10 and 15 years and the imposition of the death penalty if exploitation for armed fighting resulted in the victim's death. These penalties were sufficiently stringent and, with respect to sex trafficking, commensurate with those for other serious crimes. The government enacted a new penal code, which took effect in February 2018 and replaced elements of the 2017 law. Article 510 of the new criminal code criminalized sex and labor trafficking, including bacha bazi. Article 511 increased the penalties for trafficking offenses by prescribing penalties of five to 10 years imprisonment for trafficking offenses involving adult male victims, and 10 to 16 years imprisonment if the victim was a woman or child, or exploited in bacha bazi. Article 512 outlined aggravating factors and increased penalties to 16 to 20 years imprisonment for sex trafficking or forced armed fighting and between 20 to 30 years if the victim forced to fight died while subjected to trafficking. These penalties were sufficiently stringent and, with respect to sex trafficking, commensurate with those for other serious crimes, such as rape. The new penal code also created a separate chapter to criminalize bacha bazi crimes specifically. Although this chapter explicitly criminalized more trafficking offenses relating to the crime of bacha bazi, it also prescribed lower penalties for certain acts constituting bacha bazi than those prescribed under Article 510. Most of these penalties were not sufficiently stringent, nor commensurate with the penalties prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. The government also used the 2009 Law on the Elimination of Violence Against Women to prosecute and convict sex traffickers.During the reporting period, the government reported the investigation of 132 alleged traffickers and the prosecution of 73, including five for attempted human trafficking, an increase compared with the investigation of 103 alleged traffickers and the prosecution of 63 in the previous reporting period. The government reported primary courts convicted 33 traffickers, including four for attempted human trafficking, during the reporting period\u0160the same number of persons convicted in the previous reporting period. Of the 29 convictions for human trafficking, sentences ranged from six months to 21 years imprisonment; 28 required imprisonment of one year or 65AFGHANISTANmore, and one sentence resulted in inadequate penalties of six months imprisonment. Of the four convictions for attempted human trafficking, sentences ranged from one year and one month to eight years imprisonment. The government did not report the details of cases, so its response to forced and bonded labor or bacha bazi is unknown. Law enforcement and judicial officials continued to have a limited understanding of trafficking. Dari, the language spoken most widely in Afghanistan, historically used the same word for both human trafficking and migrant smuggling, compounding the confusion. Authorities attempted to address this issue by including separate terms and definitions for trafficking and smuggling in the 2017 law; however, training required to ensure officials understood the new terminology was limited, especially at the local and provincial levels. MOI continued to operate trafficking and smuggling units in each of the 34 provinces and in Kabul, with 16 officers in Kabul and two officers in each province. Officials acknowledged the number of personnel and access to resources and training was insufficient. NGOs and international organizations, with in-kind assistance from the government for venues, conducted 656 capacity-building workshops in 2017 for over 20,000 members of the public, government officials, and civil society members, including religious leaders and lawyers. At the end of the reporting period, the high commission, with technical and financial support from an international organization, finalized a training manual to train Afghan law enforcement agencies including border police, immigration officials, members of the National Directorate of Security (NDS), NGOs specializing in counter trafficking, shelter managers, and community leaders.Official complicity in trafficking remained a serious and pervasive problem. Some government and security officials reportedly engaged in the practice of bacha bazi. Military authorities initiated internal investigations into some of these incidents, but there were no reports that these cases\u0160or any other cases of government officials allegedly complicit in human trafficking\u0160culminated in newly initiated criminal prosecutions, convictions, or the imposition of penalties during the reporting period. The Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission's 2014 report assessed that most who engage in bacha bazi paid bribes to, or had relationships with, law enforcement, prosecutors, or judges that effectively exempted them from prosecution. In February 2017, a district chief of police and six members of the security forces were arrested for allegedly participating in a bacha bazi gathering; the district chief of police was fired from his position during the previous reporting period and was still awaiting trial at the end of the 2018 reporting period. The government did not report what action, if any, was taken against the security forces. The UN verified the continued use of children in combat and non-combat roles by the government during the reporting period, including at least seven cases of recruitment by the Afghan National Police, seven by the Afghan Local Police (ALP), and one by the NDS. One of the verified cases of ALP use of children involved two boys exploited in bacha bazi. There were reports that pro-government militias, who may have received direct financial support from the Afghan government, employed children in non-combat roles. Observers reported some officials accepted bribes to produce identity documents for boys stating their age was above 18 years old. ","protection":"The government increased efforts to identify victims. The government did not compile comprehensive victim identification, referral, and assistance statistics; however, the high commission reported identifying 476 potential trafficking victims in 2017 compared with 23 victims identified by the government and 93 victims identified by NGOs in 2016. The government attributed the increase in identified victims to rising insecurity and poverty and stated the majority of those identified were teenagers who had been deceived into believing they would be transported to Europe for work; the government did not provide sufficient information on these cases to differentiate among trafficking, smuggling, and other related crimes. The government did not use systematic identification procedures for victims during the reporting period. The government noted district and provincial-level officials continued to conftate trafficking and smuggling and many officials were unable to confidently identify trafficking victims. In partnership with an international organization, the high commission developed a training manual for government officials and civil society that included indicators of human trafficking and standard operating procedures for the identification and referral of victims to rehabilitation services. The high commission and the international organization finalized the manual at the end of the reporting period and, thus, had not yet initiated its rollout or implementation. Police lacked formal guidelines and funding to provide basic care (including water and food) to victims during investigations. In some instances, police officers paid out-of-pocket for basic victim care. The Ministry of Labor, Social Affairs, Martyrs and Disabled (MOLSAMD) provided registration, referral, and social services for trafficking victims, including those repatriated to Afghanistan from other countries; however, it did not provide data on such efforts. NGOs operated 29 women's protection shelters in 21 provinces that provided protection, legal, and social services to female victims of violence, which were available to trafficking victims. The Ministry of Women's Affairs monitored and regulated all women's protective shelters through site visits to ensure compliance with women's centers' regulations and guidelines and hosted national and provincial coordination committees to discuss the findings of visits and to address challenges. Family guidance centers in 19 provinces provided non-residential legal and social services for women and children, including trafficking victims. The Child Protection Action Network (CPAN), a conglomerate of NGOs, civil society, and government entities overseen by MOLSAMD, provided shelter and some protection services to child victims in 110 districts. NGOs operated two shelters for victims of labor and sex trafficking in Kabul, including one specifically dedicated to serving boys under age 18. At times, the government placed child victims in orphanages, although some children in orphanages were subjected to trafficking. The international organization-run, government-owned, short-term trafficking shelter in Kabul closed during the reporting period when donor funding was not renewed. There continued to be no shelters for adult male victims. The government did not encourage victims to participate in investigations; it did not provide adequate support, security, or protective services for victims to safely do so without risk of re-traumatization. Afghan law allows foreign victims to remain temporarily in Afghanistan for at least six months. In 2017, there were no reports of foreign victims identified in Afghanistan.Authorities sometimes treated victims, including children, as criminals simply for being unchaperoned or for having committed moral crimes; officials continued to arrest, imprison, or otherwise punish victims for prostitution or sex outside of marriage, without regard to whether they had been subjected to forced prostitution, or for escaping from husbands who forced 66AFGHANISTANthem into prostitution. Authorities sometimes prosecuted victims for possessing forged identity documents. Article 518 of the new penal code provided that a trafficking victim shall not be prosecuted for crimes committed while being subjected to trafficking or for the possession or use of fraudulent travel documents. Officials sometimes placed male and female victims in prison if they could not be accommodated in shelters. NGOs reported some child trafficking victims were housed in juvenile detention centers, sometimes for several years. Male sex trafficking victims, including those subjected to bacha bazi, were in some cases referred to juvenile rehabilitation centers on criminal charges. During the reporting period, four victims of bacha bazi who had been previously arrested were released without charges. The government did not demobilize child soldiers associated with governmental or nongovernmental armed groups or provide or refer such children for reintegration support.","recommendation":"Cease the unlawful recruitment and use of children by Afghan security forces and demobilize children from state and non-state groups with adequate victim protection and reintegration support; while respecting due process, increase investigations and prosecutions, including of law enforcement and members of the military suspected of being complicit in trafficking such as bacha bazi, and convict and appropriately sentence the perpetrators; cease the penalization of victims for offenses committed as a direct result of being subjected to trafficking, including stopping prosecutions for moral crimes and the placement of child trafficking victims in juvenile detention centers; formally adopt and disseminate standard operating procedures for victim identification and referral to rehabilitation services and train officials on their use; amend Chapter 5 of the penal code to increase the penalties for bacha bazi in line with penalties prescribed for other forms of trafficking; strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Interior (MOI)'s anti-traffickingsmuggling units, including increasing the number of staff in each region and ensuring their ability to differentiate between smuggling and trafficking; continue to increase the capacity of the High Commission for Combating Crimes of Abduction and Human TraffickingSmuggling (high commission) to coordinate and report on the government's anti-trafficking efforts; continue to educate officials at national, provincial, and local levels on the definition of human trafficking, as well as identification, protection, and law enforcement strategies; improve efforts to collect, analyze, and accurately report counter-trafficking data; dedicate resources to support long-term victim rehabilitation programs; and proactively inform government officials, especially at the MOI and Ministry of Defense (MOD), of the law prohibiting the recruitment and enlistment of minors, and enforce these provisions with criminal prosecutions.","tier":"TIER 2","traffick_profile":"As reported over the past five years, Afghanistan is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking. Internal trafficking is more prevalent than transnational trafficking. Men, women, and children are exploited in bonded labor in Afghanistan, where an initial debt assumed by a worker as part of the terms of employment is exploited, ultimately entrapping other family members, sometimes for multiple generations. There are entire Afghan families trapped in debt bondage in the brick-making industry in eastern Afghanistan. Most Afghan trafficking victims are children exploited in carpet making and brick factories, domestic servitude, commercial sex, begging, poppy cultivation, salt mining, transnational drug smuggling, and assistant truck driving within Afghanistan. Some Afghan families knowingly sell their children into sex trafficking, including for bacha bazi, including some government officials and security forces. There are reports that some law enforcement officials, prosecutors, and judges accept bribes from or use their relationships with perpetrators of bacha bazi to allow them to escape punishment. Opium-farming families sometimes sell their children to settle debts with opium traffickers. Children in orphanages overseen by the government, but run by NGOs, were sometimes subjected to trafficking. Members of the Shia Hazara minority group were victims of forced labor. Afghan returnees from Pakistan and Iran and internally displaced Afghans are vulnerable to exploitation in sex trafficking and forced and bonded labor. Men, women, and children in Afghanistan often pay intermediaries to assist them in finding employment, primarily in Iran, Pakistan, India, Europe, or North America; some of these intermediaries force Afghans into labor or prostitution. Afghan women and girls are subjected to sex trafficking and domestic servitude primarily in Pakistan, Iran, and India, including through forced marriages in Iran and Pakistan. Afghan boys and men are subjected to forced labor and debt bondage in agriculture and construction, primarily in Iran, Pakistan, Greece, Turkey, and the Gulf states. Boys, especially those traveling unaccompanied, are particularly vulnerable to trafficking. Some Afghan boys are subjected to sex trafficking in Greece after paying high fees to be smuggled into the country. Reportedly, the Iranian government and the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) coerce male Afghan migrants, including boys as young as 12, to fight in Syria in IRGC-organized and commanded militias, by threatening them with arrest and deportation to Afghanistan. The government and armed non-state groups in Afghanistan unlawfully recruit and use children in combat and non-combat roles. Armed non-state groups, mostly the Taliban, but also including other non-state groups like the Islamic State in Khorasan Province (ISIS-K), account for most child recruitment and use. Insurgent groups forcibly recruit and use children as suicide bombers. The Taliban indoctrinate children using religious and military education and teach children to use small arms and deploy improvised explosive devices. Some families receive cash payments or protection in exchange for sending their children to the Taliban-run schools. Children from impoverished and rural areas, particularly those under Taliban control, are especially vulnerable to recruitment. The Afghan Local and National Police and government-supported armed groups use children in combat and non-combat roles, including as personal servants, support staff, and body guards. The Afghan National Army, NDS, and Afghan Border Police also recruit children, although to a lesser extent. There were reports that some members of the Afghan security forces and 67ALBANIAother groups of non-state actors sexually abuse and exploit young girls and boys. There were reports of women and girls from the Philippines, Pakistan, Iran, Tajikistan, Sri Lanka, and China subjected to sex trafficking in Afghanistan. Under the pretense of high-paying employment opportunities, some labor recruiting agencies lure foreign workers to Afghanistan, including from Sri Lanka, Nepal, India, Iran, Pakistan, and Tajikistan; the recruiters subject these migrants to forced labor after arrival."},"Albania":{"April":0.0,"Asylum Seekers":"19","August":1.0,"December":0.0,"February":0.0,"Friday":0.0,"Global Population":2882.74,"January":0.0,"July":0.0,"June":0.0,"Life Expectancy":78.46,"March":0.0,"May":0.0,"Monday":0.0,"November":0.0,"October":0.0,"Population below $1.90 a day":"1.7","Saturday":0.0,"September":0.0,"Sunday":0.0,"Thursday":1.0,"Tuesday":0.0,"Violence against civilians":1,"Wednesday":0.0,"fatalities":["0"],"government_effort":"NA","introduction":"The Government of Albania does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. The government demonstrated increasing efforts compared to the previous reporting period; therefore Albania remained on Tier 2. The government increased funding for victim protection, and identified and assisted more victims. The government, in cooperation with NGOs, reactivated mobile identification units in three regions and strengthened child protection within the criminal justice system. The government also admitted one victim into the witness protection program. However, the government did not meet minimum standards in several key areas. The government continued to penalize victims for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being subjected to human trafficking. The government reported fewer prosecutions and convictions, and authorities continued to investigate and prosecute some traffickers for the lesser crime of exploitation of prostitution. The government delayed funding to NGO-run shelters and did not consistently apply victim-centered investigations and prosecutions. Police did not consistently identify trafficking victims among individuals in prostitution, and the labor inspectorate lacked the training to identify victims of forced labor. Identification efforts for forced begging remained inadequate, particularly among unaccompanied children, street children, and children moving across the borders for begging.

The journalist's children, parents and brother were at home at the time of the attack. No injuries were reported. Lala was known for reporting about organized crime and justice for more than a decade and it was suspected that the attack was linked to her work as a journalist.","prevention":"The government increased efforts to prevent trafficking. The government allocated 5.7 million lek ($51,540) to the Office of the National Anti-Trafficking Coordinator (ONAC) in 2016 and 2017. The national action plan expired in December 2017, but ONAC, in cooperation with an international organization, convened three meetings with stakeholders to begin developing a new plan. ONAC continued to publish regular activity reports on its website and held four meetings with stakeholders involved in the NRM. Observers reported prosecutors rarely attended NRM meetings. Twelve regional anti-trafficking committees (RATC) comprising local officials and NGOs worked on prevention and victim assistance. The prime minister issued an order to strengthen the RATCs by mandating the government agencies required to participate, including social services, law enforcement, labor inspectors, and health representatives. ONAC and national anti-trafficking coordinators from Montenegro and Kosovo signed a joint declaration ensuring the application of a unified SOP for victim protection and assisted voluntary repatriation. ONAC, in cooperation with civil society, conducted a month long awareness campaign and separate awareness campaigns targeting students and teachers. ONAC also conducted informative meetings with representatives from the Romani and Balkan Egyptian communities. The hotline received six calls that were trafficking-related and referred to law enforcement. The government did not make efforts to regulate or punish labor recruiters for illegal practices that increase migrants' vulnerability to exploitation abroad. Labor inspectors did not have authority to inspect informal work activities, including unregistered businesses. The government conducted awareness campaigns on sex tourism but did not take steps to reduce demand for forced labor. The government provided anti-trafficking guidance for its diplomatic personnel, and the national coordinator briefed Albanian diplomats stationed in nine cities on human trafficking regulations.69ALGERIA","prosecution":"The government decreased law enforcement efforts. Articles 110(a) and 128(b) of the criminal code criminalized sex and labor trafficking and prescribed penalties of five to 15 years imprisonment and a fine between two million lek ($18,080) and five million lek ($45,210), which were sufficiently stringent and, with respect to sex trafficking, commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. The state police investigated 69 cases with 80 suspects (69 cases with 69 suspects in 2016); 22 of these suspects in 2017 were investigated for child trafficking (22 in 2016) and 58 for adult trafficking (47 in 2016). The Serious Crimes Prosecutor's Office (SCPO) prosecuted five defendants (18 in 2016); two of these suspects were prosecuted for child trafficking (nine in 2016) and three for adult trafficking (nine in 2016). Courts convicted seven traffickers (24 in 2016); one trafficker was convicted for child trafficking (11 in 2016) and six for adult trafficking (13 in 2016). All convicted traffickers received prison sentences, which ranged between eight years and eight months to 17 years. Authorities continued to investigate and prosecute some traffickers for the lesser crime of exploitation of prostitution. Authorities reported the confusion between overlapping elements of exploitation of prostitution and trafficking and at times applied the lesser charge because it required less specialization and time, or due to the false belief that trafficking crimes required a transnational element. The government enacted judicial reforms that will eventually change court jurisdiction for trafficking cases; cases not related to organized crime will soon fall from the Serious Crimes Court to district courts, but authorities reported district prosecutors did not have the experience and capacity to adequately prosecute trafficking cases. The government operated a closed case task force to review successful and unsuccessful trafficking cases; so far the task force has only reviewed two cases. Observers reported limited resources and constant turnover within law enforcement created obstacles in maintaining capacity to investigate trafficking. The government, at times in cooperation with civil society, trained 20 police officers; 100 employees of local law enforcement; 40 border police officers; and 127 judges, prosecutors, and judicial police officers. The government did not report any investigations, prosecutions, or convictions of government employees complicit in trafficking offenses; however, official complicity and corruption were significant concerns. The government signed extradition agreements with the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland and conducted joint investigations with Italian and Spanish law enforcement.","protection":"The government maintained victim protection efforts. The government and NGOs identified 105 potential trafficking victims (95 in 2016). Of these, 49 were adults and 56 were children (51 adults and 44 children in 2016), 80 were female and 25 were male (84 females and 11 males in 2016), and nine were foreigners (eight in 2016). Seventy-nine were identified as potential victims and 26 officially identified as victims (62 potential victims and 33 officially identified victims in 2016). A multi-disciplinary national referral mechanism (NRM) provided standard operating procedures (SOPs) for identifying and referring victims to services. The government, with the 68ALBANIAsupport of NGOs, reactivated mobile identification units in three regions, but the unit's sustainability was uncertain due to a lack of permanent staff, formalization, and resources; mobile identification units identified 26 potential victims. Additionally, the government referred 60 potential victims, civil society referred 16, and three self-identified. Observers reported police did not consistently identify trafficking victims among individuals in prostitution and the labor inspectorate lacked the training to identify victims of forced labor. Similarly, identification efforts for forced begging remained inadequate, particularly among unaccompanied children, street children, and children moving across the borders for begging. First responders referred potential trafficking victims to law enforcement and state social services who conducted a joint interview and provided official victim status. The law provided equal services for both potential victims and officially recognized victims. The government operated one specialized shelter and supported three specialized NGO-run shelters. The government provided 20.2 million lek ($182,640) to NGO-run shelters to support 29 staff salaries, compared to 15.3 million lek ($138,340) to support 24 staff salaries in 2016. The government used 4.7 million lek ($42,500) in 2016 and 2017 from the special fund of seized criminal assets to support services. The government provided 5.5 million lek ($49,730) for food support to NGO-run shelters, compared to 1.8 million lek ($16,280) in 2016. However, the government reorganized the Ministry of Social Welfare and Youth and State Social Services into the new Ministry of Health and Social Care, which contributed to delays in funding, including funding for staff salaries and food support. NGO-run shelters operated under financial constraints and relied on outside sources for operating costs; government financial mechanisms intended to partially fund these shelters remained complicated. The four shelters comprised the National Coalition of Anti-trafficking Shelters (NCATS) and victims who required services not available in one shelter were referred to another shelter within the coalition. The NCATS provided assistance to trafficking victims, including food, counseling, legal assistance, medical care, educational services, employment services, assistance to victims' children, financial support, long-term accommodation, social activities, vocational training, and post-reintegration follow-up. The government provided free vocational training, textbooks for child victims, and health cards that provided free access to health care; however, the government offered limited reintegration support and did not provide funding for reintegration services. Experts reported first responders often referred individuals that were not trafficking victims to the government-run shelter, including individuals with mental health issues or victims of other crimes. NGO-run shelters supported 71 trafficking victims and potential victims (75 in 2016) and the state-run shelter supported 30 (30 in 2016). NGO-run shelters allowed adult victims to leave the shelter voluntarily, but the state-run shelter required victims to seek approval from the director of the shelter. One NGO-run shelter provided specialized services for child victims under the age of 18 and male victims were provided with rented apartments, where they received assistance from NGOs. Foreign victims had access to the same services as domestic victims and the law provided foreign victims a three-month reftection period with temporary residency status and authorization to work for up to two years. The government granted residency to six foreign victims in 2017 (none in 2016). Observers reported professional staff and good quality of care at the shelters in the NCATS but reported low staff levels at the government-run shelter after staff were transferred to the domestic violence center and the facility required renovations.The government penalized one victim for an unlawful act committed as a direct result of being subjected to trafficking; as in similar cases in past years, authorities convicted an officially identified trafficking victim for prostitution and sentenced her to eight months of probation. The government may have deported, detained, or restricted freedom of movement of some trafficking victims due to inadequate identification efforts. SCPO possessed equipment that allowed testimony via video conferences and victims who testified against traffickers had access to the witness protection program; one trafficking victim participated in the program. The government adopted several laws strengthening child protection within the criminal justice system, such as the participation of a psychologist in criminal proceedings involving children. Twenty-three trafficking victims cooperated with law enforcement in investigations and prosecutions; however, the government did not consistently apply victim-centered investigations and prosecutions. Law enforcement did not consistently offer sufficient security and support, victims and their families received threats during court proceedings, and some victims appeared in front of their traffickers in court proceedings, causing re-traumatization. Victims could obtain restitution from the government or file civil suits against traffickers; no victim had ever received restitution. The law provided repatriation assistance to Albanians citizens identified abroad; four potential victims were repatriated from Germany, Kosovo, the Netherlands, and Norway (none in 2017). ","recommendation":"Implement the law that exempts victims from penalties for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being subjected to trafficking, particularly sex trafficking victims exploited in prostitution; vigorously investigate, prosecute, and convict traffickers\u0160including complicit officials\u0160under article 110(a) and 128(b); train investigators, prosecutors, and judges on victim-centered approaches to trafficking cases and increase victim protection from threats and intimidation during court proceedings; continue to train law enforcement, prosecutors, and judicial officials, particularly district prosecutors, on investigating, prosecuting, and trying trafficking cases, including guidance on overlapping elements of exploitation of prostitution and trafficking; allocate adequate funding and resources on a consistent and regular basis to the government-run and NGO-run shelters for trafficking victims; improve the sustainability of mobile identification units; train police, labor inspectors, and other front-line officials on proactive identification of victims and increase efforts to screen children for signs of trafficking; and adopt a national action plan and allocate sufficient resources to the plan.

Albanian women and children are subject to sex trafficking and forced labor within the country, especially during tourist season. Traffickers use false promises such as marriage or employment offers to force victims into sex trafficking. Traffickers increasingly use social media to recruit victims. Children are commonly forced to beg or perform other types of compelled labor such as selling small items. Albanian children, mainly from the Romani community, are exploited regionally for seasonal work. There were also instances of children forced to work in cannabis fields in Albania and some traffickers are likely involved in drug trafficking. Albanian victims are subject to sex trafficking in countries across Europe, particularly Kosovo, Greece, Italy, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, Macedonia, Norway, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. NGOs report an increase in the number of Albanian children subjected to forced labor in Kosovo and the United Kingdom. Foreign victims from European countries and the Philippines were subjected to sex trafficking and forced labor in Albania. Irregular migrants from Asia are employed as domestic workers by wealthy families where they are vulnerable to domestic servitude.

The government demonstrated significant efforts during the reporting period by its increased number of investigations and prosecutions of alleged traffickers under the anti-trafficking statute, the identification of 33 victims, and increased training for judicial practitioners. The government also established and dedicated resources for a national anti-trafficking committee under the prime minister's office and inaugurated a national day against trafficking in persons. Despite these achievements, the government did not report any convictions for trafficking-related offenses and did not implement its National Action Plan for the Prevention of and Fight Against Trafficking in Persons. It did not systematically identify trafficking victims among vulnerable populations or have a standardized mechanism in place to refer potential victims to government- or NGO-run protection services, and did not provide adequate protection services for all trafficking victims. Due to a lack of formal victim identification and screening procedures, potential trafficking victims remained at risk of penalization by the law enforcement system for acts committed as a direct result of being subjected to trafficking, such as immigration violations and prostitution. Therefore Algeria remained on Tier 2 Watch List for the second consecutive year.

The government began to implement its September 2016 presidential decree, which formally institutionalized the inter-ministerial anti-trafficking committee, placed it under the auspices of the prime minister's office, and dispersed the funds in its dedicated budget. The committee was composed of 20 members from various government ministries and institutions who met several times during the year to coordinate the government's anti-trafficking activities, including implementation of the government's 2015 national anti-trafficking action plan. The NCPFAT and National Council on Human Rights (CNDH) held a major public awareness event for the International Day Against Trafficking in Persons. The government did not make efforts to reduce the demand for commercial sex or forced labor during the reporting period. The government began drafting a new migration law that would create a stronger legal framework for migration and asylum. The government provided anti-trafficking training as a part of its broader human rights training for its diplomatic personnel.","prosecution":"The government increased efforts to investigate and prosecute trafficking offenders. Algeria criminalized sex and labor trafficking under section 5 of its penal code. Prescribed penalties under this statute ranged from three to 20 years imprisonment, which were sufficiently stringent and, with regard to sex trafficking, commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. Law No.14-01, which criminalized the buying and selling of children younger than the age of 18, prescribed penalties of three to 20 years imprisonment for individuals and groups convicted of committing or attempting to commit this crime; however, this law could be interpreted to include such non-trafficking crimes as migrant smuggling or illegal adoption. The NCPFAT cooperated with the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) to draft a new anti-trafficking law in order to consolidate all trafficking-related statutes in one place and institutionalize some of the measures currently taken on an ad hoc basis. NCPFAT is working with the MOJ, the Director General of National Security (DGSN), the Ministry of National Defense, and the National Gendarmerie (Police) on a database on trafficking victims, prosecutions, and convictions; however, the database was not operational at the end of the reporting period. During the reporting period, the government reported investigating four cases involving 26 alleged traffickers and prosecuting 22 defendants under the anti-trafficking law in three of these cases, as compared with investigating and prosecuting 16 alleged perpetrators last year. Four suspects allegedly exploited two children in child sex trafficking, three suspects reportedly exploited five undocumented sub-Saharan migrants in forced labor and an unspecified number of perpetrators allegedly exploited 12 Malian girls in domestic 70ALGERIAservitude. While the government did not report specifically convicting any trafficking offenders, it did report sentencing 14 of 79 alleged perpetrators of child labor offenses to jail, some of whom may have been involved in human trafficking. The government did not provide updated information on cases reported in previous years, including the outcome of 16 prosecutions that remained pending at the end of the previous reporting period. The government requested assistance from Nigerien judicial authorities in its ongoing investigation of the September 2016 case against six alleged traffickers, as it continued to search for four alleged traffickers who were at large at the end of the previous reporting period. The government did not report any investigations, prosecutions, or convictions of government officials complicit in trafficking offenses. The DGSN maintained six police brigades to monitor illegal immigration and human trafficking and provided staff with specialized training. It also maintained 50 brigades specializing in combating crimes against children, including trafficking crimes. The government reported working actively through the African Union Mechanism for Police Coordination to increase international coordination in combating trafficking in persons. Algeria hosted the UNODC's regional North Africa-Sahel forum, which included discussions of human trafficking with representatives from Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Mauritania, Niger, Mali, Chad, and Burkina Faso. The government also contributed to INTERPOL's databases on human trafficking and migrant smuggling. The National Police, the MOJ, and the NCPFAT participated in the UNODC's Working Group on Trafficking in Vienna. Thirty police officers received training on trafficking at the Algiers police academy. The National Police organized a seminar in December 2017 on the judicial police's role in combating smuggling and trafficking in persons for investigators who interact with sub-Saharan migrants. The government also organized five conferences on trafficking in persons for judges. ","protection":"The government maintained protection efforts. The government identified 33 trafficking victims during the reporting period, including 19 males and 14 females, 20 adults and 13 children, one Algerian and 32 West African victims; this compared with 65 potential victims identified in the prior reporting period. The government reported that these identified victims received care and protection services. The government did not have a formal mechanism to generally identify or refer potential victims to protection services, but reported drafting an order that included such procedures, which awaited the prime minister's signature at the end of the reporting period. The government also remained without measures to screen for trafficking victimization among vulnerable groups, including migrants and persons in prostitution. The National Police provided investigators with a guide of indicators of trafficking in persons, and set up a hotline and website for victims of crimes, including trafficking, to submit reports to the police. The government reported that the hotline received over a million calls and the website received 2,264 trafficking tips; however, the government did not report if any of the calls or tips led to criminal investigations. The DGSN provided its officers with an INTERPOL manual on the trafficking and sexual exploitation of women. Government officials admitted difficulty distinguishing trafficking victims from irregular migrants and identifying trafficking victims among ethnically cohesive migrant communities. Officials continued to rely on victims to report abuses to authorities; however, trafficking victims among the migrant populations typically did not report potential trafficking crimes to the police for fear of arrest and deportation. Additionally, trafficking victims were legally entitled to file civil suits against their offenders, but the government did not report cases in which victims did so during the reporting period. Many undocumented migrants, fearing deportation, avoided public services, and the government acknowledged that foreign victims did not come forward to bring trafficking cases to the attention of police. The government's frequent operations to deport irregular immigrants may have fueled the smuggling industry and further discouraged foreign trafficking victims from making their presence known to authorities. International NGOs reported that the government deported thousands of migrants, including some minors, from a range of countries to the desert border or neighboring countries during the reporting period. Observers also reported that the government did not screen migrants for potential trafficking victimization before deporting them or moving them to government transit centers. Thus, potential trafficking victims among migrant populations continued to face punishment, such as arrest and deportation, for illegal migration and other crimes committed as a direct result of being subjected to human trafficking. The government did not provide foreign victims with legal alternatives to their removal to countries where they faced retribution or hardship.","recommendation":"Implement the 2016 presidential decree requiring the National Committee for the Prevention and Fight Against Trafficking in Persons (NCPFAT) to vigorously investigate, prosecute, and convict sex and labor trafficking offenders and punish them with sufficiently stringent penalties; establish formal procedures for proactive victim identification and referral to care, and train law enforcement, judicial, and health care officials and social workers on these procedures; provide additional training to labor inspectors and criminal law enforcement personnel to build enforcement capacity to address labor trafficking and identify human trafficking victims; develop formal mechanisms to provide appropriate protection services, either directly or through support and partnership with NGOs and international organizations, including a designated shelter, and provide adequate medical and psycho-social care, legal aid, and repatriation assistance to all trafficking victims; ensure victims do not face arrest, deportation, or other punishment for acts committed as a direct result of being subjected to trafficking; ensure the safe and voluntary repatriation of foreign victims, including through collaboration with relevant organizations and source country embassies, and provide foreign victims with legal alternatives to their removal to countries where they faced retribution or hardship, continue public awareness efforts regarding the indicators and risks of trafficking, including the difference between human trafficking and smuggling; monitor and report the number of criminal investigations, prosecutions and convictions; and implement the national anti-trafficking action plan.","tier":"TIER 2 WATCH LIST","traffick_profile":"As reported over the past five years, Algeria is a transit and destination country for migrants\u0160men, women, and children\u0160and, in very isolated cases, a source country for children subjected to sex trafficking and men subjected to forced labor. Undocumented sub-Saharan migrants, primarily from Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Guinea, Liberia, and Nigeria, are most vulnerable to labor and sex trafficking in Algeria, mainly due to their irregular migration status, poverty, and language barriers. Unaccompanied women and women traveling with children are also particularly vulnerable to commercial sexual exploitation and forced domestic work. Sub-Saharan African men and women, often en route to neighboring countries or Europe, enter Algeria voluntarily but illegally, frequently with the assistance of 71ANGOLAsmugglers or criminal networks. Many migrants, impeded in their initial attempts to reach Europe, remain in Algeria until they can continue their journey. While facing limited opportunities in Algeria, many migrants illegally work in construction and some engage in prostitution to earn money to pay for their onward journey to Europe, which puts them at high risk of exploitation. Some migrants become indebted to smugglers, who subsequently exploit them in forced labor and sex trafficking upon arrival in Algeria. For example, female migrants in the southern city of Tamanrasset\u0160the main entry point into Algeria for migrants and for the majority of foreign trafficking victims\u0160are subjected to debt bondage as they work to repay smuggling debts through domestic servitude, forced begging, and forced prostitution. Some migrants also fall into debt to fellow nationals who control segregated ethnic neighborhoods in Tamanrasset; these individuals pay migrants' debts to smugglers and then force the migrants into bonded labor or prostitution. Tuareg and Maure smugglers and traffickers in northern Mali and southern Algeria force or coerce men to work as masons or mechanics; women to wash dishes, clothes, and cars; and children to draw water from wells in southern Algeria. Victims also report experiencing physical and sexual abuse at the hands of smugglers and traffickers. Many sub-Saharan migrant women in southern Algeria willingly enter into relationships with migrant men to provide basic shelter, food, income, and safety, in return for sex, cooking, and cleaning. While many of these relationships are purportedly consensual, these women are at risk of trafficking, and migrants in Tamanrasset reported instances of women prevented from leaving the home and raped by their \ufb01partner.\ufb02 Foreign women and children, primarily sub-Saharan African migrants, are exploited in sex trafficking in bars and informal brothels, typically by members of their own communities, in Tamanrasset and Algiers. Nigerien female migrants begging in Algeria, who often carry children\u0160sometimes rented from their mothers in Niger\u0160may be forced labor victims. Nigerien children, ranging from 4 to 8 years old, are brought to Algeria by trafficking networks with the consent of their parents and forced to beg for several months in Algeria before being returned to their families in Niger. Media and civil society organizations reported in 2015 that some sub-Saharan African migrant women working in domestic service for Algerian families experience physical abuse, confiscation of passports, and withheld pay. In 2014, the media and an international NGO reported Vietnamese migrants were forced to work on construction sites for Chinese contractors in Algeria. In 2015, civil society organizations reported isolated instances of foreign and Algerian children in sex trafficking and in forced labor on construction sites."},"Angola":{"April":3.0,"Asylum Seekers":"8","August":1.0,"December":4.0,"February":0.0,"Friday":6.0,"Global Population":30809.79,"January":0.0,"July":2.0,"June":1.0,"Life Expectancy":60.78,"March":0.0,"May":0.0,"Monday":3.0,"November":2.0,"October":4.0,"Population below $1.90 a day":"30.1","Saturday":2.0,"September":2.0,"Sunday":2.0,"Thursday":3.0,"Tuesday":0.0,"Violence against civilians":19,"Wednesday":3.0,"fatalities":["1","8","2","1","0","0","1","3","1","5","7","0","0","0","1","1","1","1","0"],"government_effort":"NA","introduction":"The Government of Angola does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so.

The government identified trafficking victims and referred them to care. The Inter-Ministerial Commission to Combat Trafficking in Persons continued to meet periodically during the reporting period. The government raised awareness of trafficking through radio campaigns and outreach seminars in schools, universities, and churches. However, the government did not demonstrate increasing efforts compared to the previous reporting period. The government secured zero convictions during the reporting period. The government did not collect official statistics on the number of trafficking victims identified or referred to care during the reporting period. The government did not adequately fund victim protection mechanisms, including shelters and provision of basic aftercare services. Law enforcement and social services officials lacked a standardized mechanism for screening vulnerable populations. Border security guards forcibly detained and deported tens of thousands of illegal migrants without adequate screening procedures to identify potential trafficking victims.

On Dec 24, eight other \"involuntary\" murders by policemen were reported in the Namibe province. On December 13, a police officer opened fire and killed a mother and her daughter in Luanda. They were trying to intervene in an argument between a man and the police officer, who had suspected that the man had stolen a gas container. On December 7, two police officers opened fire and killed a 14 years old girl in Luanda. They were intervening in the activity of local zungueiras, when they opened fire in order to establish order, but one of the shots hit a girl who was passing by the area. On November 24, the military forces and the police of Angola forcibly repatriated hundreds of people in Cafunfo, sending around 700 civilians to jail, including locals. Many civilians were assaulted and had personal belongings seized. On November 19, a member of the police forces of Angola sexually abused a 13 year old girl in Luanda. On Oct 7, a Criminal Investigation Service (SIC) officer shot dead a 24-year-old man who tried to escape arrest in northern Angola's Malanje province. The victim was implicated in various crimes and arrested in the past. On Oct 5, elite police from the Rapid Intervention Police (PIR) and the Chacal (Angola's Israeli-trained special forces branch) were deployed to Lucapa after violence the previous days between locals and Congolese migrants. They killed a man in Kapende and two in Santa Isabel. On October 5, an Angolan was shot dead by suspected illegal African migrants involved in diamond smuggling in Lunda Norte province.The victim was accused of telling on the smugglers. The attack occurred on the margins of a police operation to arrest and then repatriate thousands of illegal migrants back to their countries. On Oct 3, a group of locals from the Tchokwe tribe burst into houses of Congolese migrants in Roque neighborhood, Lucapa. Five people were killed with machetes. The migrants are mostly from the Phende tribe. On Sept 15th, seven people died after a police charge to evacuate the stadium in Luanda where the football match 1 de Agosto - TP Mazembe had just been played. On Sept 14th, an agent of the Criminal Investigation Service of the province of Cunene, bothered by the noise of a group of minors playing in front of his yard in Ondjiva, voluntarily shot a 12-year-old child, reaching the lower limbs of the girl who received medical care. On August 30, the representative of the \"Free Hands Association\" in Huambo province accused the national police of several cases of torture in police stations against citizens accused of common crimes. No precise date or location mentioned. The police denied and requested evidence. On July 6, a UNITA PM was assaulted in his house in Luanda by 5 men wearing the uniform of the criminal investigation service. On July 4, an attack in Viana perpetrated by 30 policemen led to the death of a woman and 3 other people injured. On June 1, a SIC policeman pointed his gun at a suspected criminal and shot him in Luanda while he could not get up from the ground. The event happened while the man was taking the 7 police officers to see the pits where he used to dispose of the bodies of the people he killed. According to witnesses, minutes after the first shot, another policeman arrived and shot the man a couple more times. This is another event in the series of killings\/assassinations perpetrated by SIC police agents. On April 29, an Angolan police officer killed a young man as he was chasing a foreigner who had escaped from prison in Quimbele. On the night of April 11-12, a Guinean civilian was killed in Zona Verde, commune of Viana. Circumstances unclear. On April 4, Criminal Investigation Service policemen (SIC) tortured a man in the province of Uige.","prevention":"The government maintained its efforts to prevent human trafficking. The inter-ministerial commission\u0160established in 2014 under the direction of the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights and the Ministry of Social Assistance and Reintegration\u0160did not finalize or adopt a national action plan for the third consecutive year. The Inter-Ministerial Commission to Combat Trafficking in Persons continued to meet periodically during the reporting period. The government continued to work towards implementation of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) regional data collection tool; however, it had not fully deployed the system. The government contributed information to UNODC and SADC's first annual draft analysis report for the region. During the reporting period the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights created a page on its official website with information on human trafficking issues, providing the public with brochures on trafficking indicators, Angolan anti-trafficking legislation, and resources for victims. The government-funded several public information radio campaigns to raise awareness of trafficking and conducted outreach seminars to warn about the risks of trafficking at universities, secondary schools, and churches. The Ministry of Justice and Human Rights operated a hotline for potential victims and for the public to report suspected trafficking cases; it is unknown how many calls the hotline received. In June 2017, the government created an alert system to prevent kidnapping and crimes against children, including trafficking; however, the government did not comprehensively train authorities on the alert system's use, and the extent to which it was utilized during the reporting period was unclear. The government sought technical assistance from two international organizations to review Angola's anti-trafficking legislation, identify state and non-state actors that work on counter trafficking, and to provide recommendations to help develop a new national anti-trafficking policy. Resistance from the national police to share information in its national crime database has slowed the inter-ministerial commission's analysis of trafficking in Angola. The government did not report any efforts to reduce the demand for commercial sex or forced labor. The government did not provide anti-trafficking training for its diplomatic personnel.","prosecution":"The government made mixed law enforcement efforts. The 2014 Law about the Criminalization of Infractions Surrounding Money Laundering criminalized sex and labor trafficking and prescribed penalties of one to 15 years imprisonment, depending on the specific offense; these were sufficiently stringent and, with respect to sex trafficking, commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. Trafficking was criminalized in Chapter III, articles 18 through 23. Article 18 criminalized slavery and servitude, as well as the buying and selling of a child under 14 years of age for adoption or for slavery, with a penalty of seven to 15 years imprisonment. Article 19 criminalized the trafficking of adults and children for the purpose of sexual exploitation, forced labor or trafficking in organs by means of force, fraud or coercion, with a penalty of three to 12 years imprisonment. Article 19 made it a crime to receive services or organs that were provided by those means, subject to a lesser penalty. Article 20 made it a crime to entice or force a person to practice prostitution in a foreign country, with a penalty of two to 10 years imprisonment. Article 21 also appeared to make sex trafficking a crime; entitled \ufb01pimping,\ufb02 article 22 made it a crime to pimp children under the age of 18, without regard to means of force, fraud or coercion\u0160which is the definition of sex trafficking of children in international law\u0160with a penalty of two to 10 years imprisonment; for the use of force, fraud or coercion with a child less than 14 years old, the term of imprisonment was five to 12 years. Article 22 made it 72ANGOLAa crime to entice children to engage in prostitution in a foreign country, with sentences of three to 12 years imprisonment; with force, fraud or coercion, the sentence was three to 15 years imprisonment. These sentences were commensurate with the penalties for other serious crimes, such as rape.The government investigated three potential forced labor cases, compared with two potential sex trafficking cases in the previous reporting period. The government prosecuted six potential traffickers in cases involving 25 victims compared with one prosecution in the previous reporting period. The government did not convict any traffickers compared with three convictions during the previous reporting period. The government did not report any investigations, prosecutions, or convictions of government officials complicit in human trafficking offenses.National police academy training continued to include human trafficking provisions. The government cooperated with Namibian and German authorities in the investigation of five potential trafficking crimes involving Angolan citizens abroad; these investigations remained ongoing at the close of the reporting period. The government maintained a labor agreement with the Government of China, which required Chinese companies to follow Angolan labor laws. Angolan authorities investigated construction companies and employers, including Chinese-run operations, for alleged forced labor abuses during the reporting period.","protection":"The government decreased protection efforts. Although the government did not report official victim identification or referral data, it identified and referred to care 79 victims, including 17 children and 62 adults, compared with identifying 91 and referring 77 victims during the previous year. To stem the ftow of illegal migrants crossing into Angola, particularly from the DRC, border security forces detained and deported tens of thousands of migrants without adequate screening to identify potential trafficking victims. The UN Special Rapporteur on the Human Rights of Migrants expressed concern over reports that Angolan security forces harassed, detained, and denied legal services to irregular migrants, a population particularly vulnerable to trafficking. The government did not adequately fund victim protection mechanisms, including shelters and legal, medical, and psychological services. The government had formal guidelines in six of Angola's 18 provinces to refer trafficking victims to care; however, it is unknown whether the government followed these guidelines during the reporting period. The National Institute of Children (INAC) received referrals of child victims and managed child support centers in all 18 provinces, which provided food, shelter, basic education, and family reunification for crime victims younger than age 18; however, it was unclear if any children assisted during the year were trafficking victims. The Ministry of Social Action, Family and the Promotion of Women (MASFAMU) managed a national network of safe houses for women, counseling centers, and children's centers, which trafficking victims could access. Law enforcement and social services officials lacked a mechanism for screening vulnerable populations, including foreign workers and persons in prostitution. The government may have arrested and deported individuals for unlawful acts committed as a result of having been subjected to trafficking, including immigration and employment violations. During the previous year, authorities who found workers without work permits during labor inspections fined the employers and arrested and deported the workers. On previous occasions when authorities identified trafficking victims among foreign laborers, the Angolan government routinely repatriated them to the source countries without providing care or ensuring proper treatment upon their arrival. Angolan law does not provide foreign trafficking victims with legal alternatives to their removal to a country where they may face hardship or retribution. ","recommendation":"Increase investigations and prosecution of forced labor and sex trafficking offenses, including by complicit officials; train law enforcement officials on the 2014 money laundering law's anti-trafficking provisions; implement procedures for identifying trafficking victims, and train officials on such procedures; collect and analyze anti-trafficking law enforcement and victim protection data; investigate labor trafficking in the construction sector; develop uniform and systematic referral procedures for all provinces; increase efforts to provide shelter, counseling, and medical care for adult trafficking victims, including men, either directly or in partnership with NGOs; and launch a nationwide anti-trafficking public awareness campaign.","tier":"TIER 2 WATCH LIST","traffick_profile":"As reported over the past five years, Angola is a source and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to sex trafficking and forced labor. Angolans, including minors, endure forced labor in the brick-making, domestic service, construction, agricultural, and artisanal diamond mining sectors within the country. Angolan girls as young as 13 years old are victims of sex trafficking. Angolan adults use children younger than age 12 for forced criminal activity, because children cannot be criminally prosecuted. The provinces of Luanda, Benguela, and the border provinces of Cunene, Namibe, Zaire, Lunda Norte, and Uige are the most high-threat areas for trafficking activities. Some Angolan boys are taken to Namibia for forced labor in cattle herding, while others are forced to serve as 73ANTIGUA AND BARBUDAcouriers to transport illicit goods, as part of a scheme to skirt import fees in cross-border trade with Namibia. Angolan women and children are subjected to domestic servitude and sex trafficking in South Africa, Namibia, and European countries, including the Netherlands and Portugal.Women from Namibia, the DRC, Vietnam, and Brazil engaged in prostitution in Angola may be victims of sex trafficking. Some Chinese women are recruited by Chinese gangs and construction companies with promises of work, but later are deprived of their passports, kept in walled compounds with armed guards, and forced into prostitution to pay back the costs of their travel. Chinese, Southeast Asian, Brazilian, Namibian, Kenyan, and possibly Congolese migrants are subjected to forced labor in Angola's construction industry; they may be subject to withholding of passports, threats of violence, denial of food, and confinement. At times, workers are coerced to continue work in unsafe conditions, which at times reportedly resulted in death. Chinese workers are brought to Angola by Chinese companies that have large construction or mining contracts; some companies do not disclose the terms and conditions of the work at the time of recruitment. Undocumented Congolese migrants, including children, enter Angola for work in diamond-mining districts, where some endure forced labor or sex trafficking in mining camps. Trafficking networks recruit and transport Congolese girls as young as 12 years old from Kasai Occidental in the DRC to Angola for labor and sex trafficking.

The Anti-trafficking Ministerial Council and the Interagency Working Group against Trafficking in Persons continued to implement the 2016-2018 national action plan (NAP) and published semi-annual and annual reports of its activities. Observers reported the government did not monitor for progress or assess the impact and outcomes of the NAP. There was no mechanism for oversight and regulation of labor recruitment agencies. As a result of a legal change suspending most labor inspectorate functions in July 2015, inspectors were unable to conduct regular inspections and identify indications of forced labor. The Ministry of Health formed the Health Inspection Body (HIB), but their mandate was limited to workplace health and safety inspections and did not have authority to conduct unannounced inspections; HIB was still recruiting inspectors and did not conduct any inspections during the reporting period. The government held awareness-raising discussion at schools and campaigns targeting students and teachers. The Ministry of Diaspora distributed informative materials on the risks of trafficking to individuals crossing the border, as well as Armenians residing in the Middle East and European countries. The Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs aired a trafficking program on television and government agencies posted trafficking information on their websites, including information on hotlines operated by police and NGOs; the government did not report the number of calls. The government did not make efforts to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts or forced labor.","prosecution":"The government decreased law enforcement efforts. Articles 132 and 132-2 of the criminal code criminalized sex and labor trafficking and prescribed penalties of five to eight years imprisonment, which were sufficiently stringent, and with respect to sex trafficking, commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. The government investigated six cases (16 in 2016). Of these, two cases were sex trafficking and four were forced labor (five cases of sex trafficking, 10 of forced labor, and one case of both sex trafficking and forced labor in 2016). The government prosecuted three defendants (one in 2016); one for sex trafficking, one for forced begging, and one for forced labor. Courts convicted one sex trafficker (three sex traffickers in 2016). The trafficker received 12 years imprisonment. Observers reported the Investigative Committee (IC) or Prosecutor General's Office dropped most cases categorized as trafficking by local police due to a lack of evidence. Local investigators lacked the skills to properly interview victims, especially children; however, the IC set up child-friendly interview rooms in five regional divisions. Law enforcement investigated only formal criminal complaints filed by victims that specifically alleged trafficking and did not proactively investigate criminal activity that potentially involved trafficking. As a result, law enforcement initiated investigations only when victims self-identified. The government trained 320 prosecutors, 327 investigators from the IC, and 540 employees from penitentiary institutions on trafficking issues. The government trained 119 officials working on juvenile investigations and 21 investigators from the IC on child trafficking issues. The government also trained 174 civil servants on fighting official complicity. The government did not report any investigations, prosecutions, or convictions of government employees complicit in trafficking. Prosecution of forced labor cases involving Russia remained a challenge, where Armenian investigators continued to face difficulties collaborating with law enforcement. Similarly, the absence of diplomatic relations with Turkey continued to hinder law enforcement and victim protection efforts for cases involving Turkey.","protection":"The government decreased protection efforts. The government identified 13 victims (22 in 2016). Of these, eight were subjected to sex trafficking and five to forced labor (three sex trafficking and 19 forced labor in 2016); two were children in both 2016 and 2017; 10 were females and three were males (five females and 17 males in 2016). Experts reported an absence of proactive identification and the government relied on victims to self-identify. First responders did not use uniform indicators to screen vulnerable populations. The government provided temporary shelter, emergency medical aid, and psychological aid to potential trafficking victims during the \ufb01pre-identification stage,\ufb02 a stage where the government collected information on the potential victim within a maximum of 10 days. The Victim Identification Commission (VIC), comprised of national and local government bodies, NGOs, and international organizations, officially recognized victims based on information collected during the \ufb01pre-identification stage\ufb02. NGOs reported positive cooperation with the government and that the referral procedures functioned well. The government allocated 19,068,600 drams ($39,320) for victim protection efforts, including operational costs for an NGO-run shelter, compared to 18,846,000 drams ($38,860) in 2016. The government and local NGOs jointly provided victims legal, medical, and psychological assistance; housing; one-time monetary compensation of 250,000 drams ($515); and access to social, educational, and employment projects. The government also offered free health care but relied on NGOs to provide legal assistance, including the cost for attorneys. Two victims received health care (one in 2016) and nine victims received legal assistance. The government maintained a cooperation agreement and partially funded one specialized NGO-run shelter to provide services to victims; the NGO-run shelter assisted 19 newly-identified victims (19 in 2016), and 36 victims in total. The NGO-run shelter required adult victims to notify staff when they left shelters unescorted, but victims were free to leave if they no longer wanted assistance. Services were available to female and male victims, but male victims did not have access to a shelter. The NGO-run shelter and childcare institutions accommodated child victims. However, GRETA and OSCE reported cases of child labor and child abuse in state childcare institutions; staff at state childcare institutions considered child labor to be normal. The law designated the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to coordinate repatriation of Armenian victims from abroad, but observers reported difficulties in repatriations due to a lack of established procedures and funds to cover logistical costs; the government repatriated three victims (11 in 2016). Authorities did not make victim assistance contingent on victim cooperation with law enforcement and afforded foreign victims the same rights and services as Armenian citizens. The government did not penalize trafficking victims for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being subjected to human trafficking. Observers reported law enforcement officers in remote areas lacked information and training to inform victims 78ARUBAof their rights to protection or assistance. Victims hesitated to assist in prosecutions due to a lack of confidentiality in public testimonies, creating a fear of retaliation from traffickers and stigmatization from their family and community. Authorities did not protect victims' rights during court proceedings, including children; investigators repeatedly interrogated victims and victims always appeared in front of their traffickers in court, risking re-traumatization. The government continued to lack a formal victim-witness protection program. The government adopted a decree in 2016 that provided witness protection specifically to trafficking victims. Victims were legally entitled to obtain restitution during criminal proceedings or through a separate civil suit. Victims did not file any civil suits; however, in previous years, judges had not issued damages in civil suits, asserting that victims did not substantiate the financial damages they had suffered. The law allowed investigators to place defendants' property in custody to fund potential civil claims, but this rarely occurred in practice. ","recommendation":"Vigorously investigate, prosecute, and convict traffickers under Articles 132 and 132-2; establish and implement preventative measures for child labor and potential child trafficking in state child care institutions; increase efforts to proactively identify trafficking victims; develop standard operating procedures for screening trafficking victims and train officials on screening for trafficking among individuals in prostitution, migrants, refugees, and other at-risk populations; proactively investigate all potential trafficking offenses, even those complaints filed by victims that do not specifically mention trafficking; train investigators, prosecutors, and judges on victim-centered approaches to trafficking cases, including for children, and provide advanced training on trafficking investigations and prosecutions; allow labor inspectors to conduct regular inspections and identify victims through unannounced visits; establish formal procedures for repatriating trafficking victims from abroad, including measures to cover logistical costs; license, regulate, and educate local employment agencies and agents so they can help prevent the forced labor of Armenians abroad; work with Russian authorities to identify Armenian forced labor victims and prosecute labor traffickers; work with NGOs to find ways to identify and assist Armenian victims in Turkey; and approve legislation to establish victim-witness protection measures.

Armenian women and children are subjected to sex and labor trafficking and forced begging within the country. Some children work in agriculture, construction, and service provision within the country, where they are vulnerable to labor trafficking. Men in rural areas with little education and children staying in childcare institutions remain highly vulnerable to trafficking.

The national coordinator led the implementation of the national action plan (2014-2018) and coordinated government wide anti-trafficking efforts; however, lack of cooperation between agencies hindered interagency coordination. The government awarded 104,000 manat ($60,820) to fund 16 proposals from civil society for awareness campaigns, compared to 71,000 manat ($41,520) in 2016. The government also conducted awareness campaigns targeting youth and students. The government publicly released an annual assessment of the country's anti-trafficking efforts, including prosecution data and protection efforts. SMS helped 378 stateless persons obtain identification documents and Azerbaijani citizenship, and legalized residency for 2,500 irregular migrants. The government did not report measures to reduce the demand for commercial sex or forced labor. A presidential decree in 2015 prevented the labor inspectorate from conducting spontaneous employment inspections, which restricted proactive investigations and victim identification efforts. In 2017, the government extended the suspension period of labor inspections until 2021. ","prosecution":"The government maintained law enforcement efforts. The 2005 Law on the Fight against Trafficking in Persons and article 144 of the criminal code criminalized sex and labor trafficking and prescribed penalties of five to 10 years imprisonment, which are sufficiently stringent and, with respect to sex trafficking, commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. Law enforcement investigated 29 cases with 33 suspects (26 cases in 2016): 25 were for sex trafficking and four were for forced labor cases (22 sex trafficking and four forced labor cases in 2016). The government prosecuted 29 defendants (36 in 2016). Courts convicted 29 traffickers (28 in 2016): 25 for sex trafficking and four for forced labor (28 sex traffickers in 2016). Three traffickers received prison sentences between one to five years and 26 traffickers received sentences between five to 10 years.MIA maintained an Anti-Trafficking Department (ATD) that led most trafficking investigations. Observers reported law enforcement lacked an understanding of trafficking and the capacity to investigate trafficking, particularly law enforcement outside of Baku. Experts reported most investigations were reactive and over reliant on victim testimony. Additionally, observers reported a lack of victim-centered approaches within law enforcement, including media reports of local police and prosecutors insulting and dismissing a potential trafficking victim who attempted to self-identify. ATD held 32 trainings on trafficking issues. The government did not report any investigations, prosecutions, or convictions of government officials complicit in human trafficking offenses.84THE BAHAMAS","protection":"The government maintained victim protection efforts. The government identified 71 trafficking victims (70 in 2016); 66 female victims of sex trafficking and five male victims of forced labor (69 female sex trafficking victims and one male forced labor victim in 2016). The government did not identify any child victims in both 2016 and 2017. Sixty-eight victims were Azerbaijanis and three were foreign victims (one foreign victim in 2016). The government had SOPs for victim identification but first responders, including law enforcement, immigration, and social services personnel, were either unaware of the procedures or did not consistently follow and understand them. SOPs required first responders to refer potential victims within 24 hours to ATD, who officially recognized victims based on an investigation. NGOs and the government provided support services to some potential victims; however, individuals without official recognition did not receive the one-time government-provided allowance and did not have the ability to bring a civil claim against the alleged traffickers. Civil society referred six potential trafficking victims to ATD (466 potential victims in 2016) but ATD determined none to be victims in both 2016 and 2017; civil society members noted ATD did conduct adequate review of referred cases in making such determinations in 2017. Observers reported minimal efforts to proactively identify Azerbaijani victims of internal trafficking, including children; as a result, all officially identified victims were foreign victims exploited in Azerbaijan or Azerbaijani victims repatriated from foreign countries, likely reftecting an overemphasis on transnational movement. The government-funded an NGO to provide training workshops for local police on how to identify and assist trafficking victims. The government allocated 150,530 manat ($88,030) for victim protection, compared to 154,000 manat ($90,060) in 2016. The MIA-run trafficking-specific shelter provided accommodation, financial assistance, legal assistance, and medical and psycho-social support; 65 officially recognized victims and six potential victims received support at the MIA-run shelter (63 officially recognized victims and seven potential victims in 2016). The MIA-run shelter had separate areas for women, men, and children but limited freedom of movement for victims and required victims to submit an application to leave the shelter. Observers reported the MIA-run shelter generally did not accommodate victims who did not cooperate with law enforcement. The Victim Assistance Center (VAC) in Baku provided legal, psychological, medical, and employment assistance to officially recognized and potential trafficking victims. ATD referred 68 victims to the VAC and civil society referred 28 potential victims to the VAC. The VAC provided 44 officially recognized victims with medical aid, 52 with psychological assistance, and 53 with legal aid. The government also provided 21 officially recognized victims and potential victims with employment and 10 with vocational training. The government established a new VAC in Goychay to provide specialized rehabilitation services to trafficking victims. Civil society reported good cooperation with the VAC and praised their reintegration services. The government did not provide funding to NGO-run shelters despite relying heavily on their victim support and reintegration services to 41 victims (40 victims in 2016). NGOs remained severely underfunded and restrictive legislation governing foreign grants limited NGOs' ability to receive funding from foreign donors. Most NGO-run shelter staff who provided support services during the reporting period worked on a voluntary basis. The State Migration Service (SMS) issued temporary residence permits for two victims from Russia and one victim from Ukraine.

The government began implementing a new nation-wide referral mechanism, and it identified and provided care to more than 30 trafficking victims. It also took concrete steps to reform the sponsorship system by introducing a program to allow some undocumented workers to self-sponsor, and it launched standardized tripartite labor contracts for domestic workers. Officials developed and facilitated anti-trafficking awareness campaigns across the country, and continued to inform all incoming migrant workers of their rights under Bahraini law.

It took concrete steps to reform the sponsorship system particularly for workers who are currently undocumented. In July 2017, the LMRA launched a \ufb01ftexible work permit\ufb02 program to legalize undocumented workers while simultaneously permitting previously exploited and illegal laborers to self-sponsor, thereby commencing a shift away from the sponsorship-based employment system. By allowing higher marketplace ftexibility, stronger protections for workers' rights, and improved workplace environs, this new permit program allows up to 2,000 expatriates to apply every month to reside and work in Bahrain without needing a sponsor, after which successful applicants can work any job with any employer on a full-or 88BAHRAINpart-time basis, negotiate wages and working hours directly, and secure multiple jobs concurrently with varying employers. Currently domestic workers, workers who have absconded from their employers, and all classes of workers with valid work permits are not eligible to apply for the program. Some NGOs and source country embassies have expressed concern that unskilled workers may be dissuaded from participation in the program due to its relatively high cost of 449 Bahraini dinar ($1,190); however, the costs included a two-year work permit, health care coverage for both years, a refundable deposit for travel tickets, and an extension of residency permits. At the close of the reporting year, more than 2,200 individuals obtained a \ufb01ftexi\ufb02 work permit. Passport retention was a crime punishable under Article 395 of the Bahraini penal code. It was a crime to limit or otherwise control any person's freedom of movement in accordance with Article 19(b) of the constitution of Bahrain. Laborers may file a grievance for passport withholding with the police or LMRA; a worker may also register a complaint to the court directly if the employer refuses to return the passport. The government typically treated indicators of forced labor\u0160cases of unpaid or withheld wages, passport retention, and analogous abuses\u0160administratively as labor law violations and resolved through arbitration rather than routinely investigated for trafficking crimes; however, if arbitration was unsuccessful a worker could file a grievance against the employer in a labor court. In 2017, the government reported closure of three recruitment agencies and revocation of their licenses for contravening Bahraini labor law, and cancelled 17 additional agency licenses for non-compliance with LMRA regulations. The LMRA's Enforcement and Inspection Department employed 70 inspectors in enforcement of employment violations responsible for worksite inspections. The LMRA and the Ministry of Justice, in partnership with an international organization, trained more than 170 individuals\u0160including journalists, source country labor attaches, social workers, judges, prosecutors, and labor inspectors\u0160over the course of five separate, multi-day workshops focused on trafficking. The NCCTIP's budget during the year was 500,000 Bahraini dinar ($1.3 million) for operations and 376,000 Bahraini dinar ($997,350) for awareness and outreach programs, roughly equivalent to 528,300 and 265,000 Bahraini dinar ($1.4 million and $702,920), respectively, the year prior. The government launched an awareness campaign in both local and expatriate communities in Bahrain, involving youth of various nationalities, schools, religious institutions, and foreign embassies. In partnership with an international organization, the NCCTIP held a workshop targeting media personnel to enhance their understanding of trafficking, more accurately report on such issues, and improve the overall role of the media in combating the crime. Also during the reporting period, Bahraini officials participated in a two-day workshop, organized by the General Federation of Bahrain Trade Union, to discuss regulatory mechanisms germane to domestic workers in the region. A quasi-governmental organization produced a campaign to prevent companies from illegally withholding their employees' passports. The LMRA continued to provide booklets outlining labor rights in 13 languages common among expatriate worker populations, and distributed them upon arrival at the Bahrain International Airport and LMRA when applying for initial or renewed residency cards. The NCCTIP hotline was active to both collect reports and serve as a resource to educate workers about their rights and available services in Hindi, Telugu, Sinhalese, Tamil, Urdu, Malayalam, Arabic, and English. In 2017, the hotline received 5,388 calls, most of which pertained to labor rights, advice on workplace situations, and miscellaneous requests; it was unclear how many calls constituted instances or indicators of trafficking, but officials identified one trafficking victim and investigated an unknown number of cases as a direct result of the hotline. The government had memoranda of understanding (MOUs) with several labor exporting countries, including Nepal, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and India, which focused on oversight of recruitment agencies and protection of migrant workers in Bahrain. The government did not make discernable efforts to reduce the demand for commercial sex. The government provided anti-trafficking training for its diplomatic personnel.","prosecution":"The government increased its law enforcement efforts. The anti-trafficking law, Law No.1 of 2008, criminalized sex and labor trafficking. It prescribed penalties ranging from three to 15 years imprisonment, plus a fine of between 2,000 and 10,000 Bahraini dinar ($5,310-$26,530) and the cost of repatriating the victim(s), which were sufficiently stringent and, with respect to sex trafficking, commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. Article 325 of the penal code prescribed imprisonment of two to seven years for forced prostitution and three to 10 years if the victim was a child. The Ministry of Interior (MOI) reported investigating 31potential trafficking cases during the reporting period, all of which involved sexual exploitation of adult females, compared to 29 investigations the previous reporting period. Of the 31 investigations, officials referred 18 for prosecution, compared to 25 referred the prior year. One sex trafficking prosecution with two defendants remained ongoing from the previous year. It convicted and sentenced seven sex traffickers from Bahrain, Russia, and Bangladesh to between five and 10 years imprisonment plus fines between 2,000 and 5,000 Bahraini dinar ($5,310-$13,260); in 2016, the government convicted and similarly sentenced three traffickers. For the first time, officials convicted a Bahraini national of forced labor involving a Filipina domestic worker, from a case initially investigated during the previous reporting period. In September 2017, the High Criminal Court sentenced, under the anti-trafficking law, a police officer to five years in prison and a fine of 2,000 Bahraini dinar ($5,310), for accepting bribes from traffickers and using his position of authority to preclude any investigations of the sex trafficking ring\u0160the first known case of a government official being held criminally accountable for complicity in a trafficking crime. The government also arrested and initiated 87BAHRAINprosecution of a former police officer who used his position and connections with hotels and residential buildings to collude with a Colombian woman to lure women to Bahrain through social media under false pretenses of high salaries in legitimate jobs over a five-year timeframe; the prosecution remained ongoing at the close of it. Local press reported one additional instance of a former police officer who facilitated the exploitation of sex trafficking victims by assisting an Indian businessman with running a prostitution ring out of his hotel. The government typically treated cases of unpaid or withheld wages, passport retention, and analogous abuses that are indicators of forced labor administratively as labor law violations rather than routinely investigated for trafficking crimes. The public prosecutor received referrals from the Labor Market Regulatory Agency (LMRA) of four recruitment agencies allegedly involved in forced labor. Eight prosecutorial personnel received anti-trafficking training via the Judicial and Legal Studies Institute. Officers and MOI personnel continued to receive annual, mandatory anti-trafficking training at the Royal Academy for Police. ","protection":"The government increased efforts to protect victims, specifically the vulnerable domestic worker population. It identified 31 adult trafficking victims during the reporting period; it did not report identifying any victims the previous year. The government continued to employ standard procedures to identify potential trafficking victims, but in May 2017, the National Committee to Combat Trafficking in Persons (NCCTIP)\u0160in cooperation with two international organizations\u0160officially launched its government-wide National Referral Mechanism (NRM) to streamline the proactive identification of trafficking victims, ensure proper documentation of cases, effectively refer cases to the MOI and public prosecutor's office for an official determination as a trafficking case, and provide adequate protective provisions to victims until case resolution or voluntary repatriation. During the reporting period, the government distributed the 30-page, bilingual English-Arabic NRM booklets to all relevant ministries and nongovernmental stakeholders. The LMRA reportedly received direct referrals of 516 potential victims from a variety of sources, including the NCCTIP's hotline, police stations, other government entities, and foreign embassies. The LMRA's Expatriate Protection Unit (EPU) provided all 516 individuals\u0160some of whom were trafficking victims\u0160with shelter, food, clothing, medical care, religious support, psycho-social counseling, rehabilitation, familial reunification, translation assistance, legal counsel, and repatriation or job placement in Bahrain. The EPU continued to oversee the safe house and shelter for both male and female workers, regardless of their legal status in the country. It also maintained onsite offices for medical and mental health professionals and a representative from the police anti-trafficking unit, and provided a training room for training shelter residents and a conference space for the NCCTIP. Embassies of labor-sending countries reported they temporarily housed some victims who refused to go to the EPU or were unable to reach it. In 2017, the NCCTIP allocated 200,000 Bahraini dinar ($530,500) for the establishment of a victim assistance fund from which trafficking victims are entitled to a small grant to help them reestablish themselves either in Bahrain or in their home country, as well as monthly compensation in the event their presence in Bahrain was court-mandated to conclude a criminal trial. Labor Law No.36 of 2012 established some protections for domestic workers, requiring employers to provide a labor contract specifying working hours, annual leave, and bonuses, and to pay workers at least monthly. Multiple agencies cited difficulties conducting unannounced inspections of domestic worker accommodations and investigating allegations of abuse in the absence of an official complaint, due to cultural norms surrounding privacy in homes, which may have left some victims at risk of exploitation and without protective provisions. In December 2017, the government officially launched and publically gazetted standardized tripartite labor contracts for domestic workers. The LMRA provided all 130 registered recruitment agencies in Bahrain with copies of the new contract, which required domestic workers to sign, prior to their arrival, a comprehensive work agreement that unequivocally outlined labor rights and employment obligations. The new unified contract took effect in January 2018 and aims to strengthen protections for domestic workers by requiring employers to declare the nature of the job, hours to be worked, and salary, among other critical information. For the first time, this allowed domestic workers brought in by recruitment agencies to accept or reject an employment contract in their respective countries of origin, and the LMRA maintained copies of the contracts to assist in any future labor disputes. There were no reports victims were punished for crimes committed as a direct result of their being subjected to trafficking. Bahraini officials provided full assistance to trafficking victims regardless of their willingness to participate in investigations and court proceedings of their traffickers. The government reported it shared with all victims a full evaluation of their cases and their legal right to restitution in the event of a conviction. Victims were permitted to testify in person, via written correspondence, video recording, a closed-circuit live video, or in private. NGOs reported workers who entered the country illegally or under pretenses did not routinely benefit from Bahraini legal protections. Some migrant workers who fted abusive situations chose not to contact police to report the abuse due to being a \ufb01free visa\ufb02 holder\u0160laborers in violation of the local labor law because they are working for a non-sponsor employer after leaving the employment of the sponsor that facilitated their entry into the country. The labor law allows foreign workers to change sponsors during investigations and court proceedings; the government did not report how many workers transferred employment during the year. Workers infrequently filed complaints against employers due to distrust of the legal system, protracted court processes, inability to afford legal representation, lack of interpretation and translation services, concern over potential loss of residence permits during proceedings, and fear of additional maltreatment due to employer reprisal. The government did not report how many third country nationals it repatriated to their countries of origin during the reporting period.","recommendation":"Increase efforts to investigate, prosecute, and convict traffickers, particularly cases involving forced labor or allegedly complicit officials; expand and fully implement reforms to the sponsorship system; vigorously investigate and prosecute potential trafficking cases involving passport retention and non-payment of wages as trafficking crimes; continue to implement formal procedures to identify trafficking victims among vulnerable groups, such as domestic workers, migrant workers, and women in prostitution; continue to implement the national referral mechanism to refer identified victims to protection services; amend ftexible work permit provisions to ensure ftexible work permit holders have the same labor protections as other workers; expand and actively enforce labor law protections for domestic workers; strengthen training for officials on the anti-trafficking law and victim identification; continue to conduct national anti-trafficking awareness campaigns, strategically targeting migrant and domestic workers.","tier":"TIER 1","traffick_profile":"As reported over the past five years, Bahrain is a destination country for men and women subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking. Men and women, primarily from Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Philippines, Nepal, Egypt, Jordan, Yemen, Thailand, Syria, and Kenya, among other countries, migrate voluntarily to Bahrain to work as semi-skilled or unskilled laborers in the construction and service industries. In recent years, and particularly during the current reporting period, the greatest inftux of workers hailed from Bangladesh, and the Bangladeshi population represented the majority of undocumented workers. Some migrant workers are subjected to forced labor in Bahrain; indicators include passport retention, strict confinement, contract substitution, non-payment of wages, debt bondage, threats or intimidation, and physical or sexual abuse, which preclude employees from reporting instances of exploitation. Nationals of countries without diplomatic presence in Bahrain are particularly vulnerable to trafficking, as are domestic workers, who are only partially protected under Bahraini labor law and cultural norms and existing legal infrastructure avert private home inspection. During the reporting period, local press reported women from Russia, Thailand, and Colombia were recruited to Bahrain via social media platforms or Bahrain-based acquaintances with false pretenses of high-paying jobs and subsequently forced into prostitution. Government and NGO officials report physical abuse and sexual assault of female domestic workers are significant problems in Bahrain, and domestic workers hailing from African countries are increasingly susceptible to labor exploitation and arrive in Bahrain through direct recruitment by local employers. Many migrant workers are paired with employers through intermediaries in Bahrain and unlicensed recruiters in their respective countries of origin, in addition to back-and-forth movement between Saudi Arabia and Bahrain via the causeway as Saudi nationals are able to sponsor foreign workers in Bahrain. Some migrant workers are not in possession of their employment contracts and are generally unfamiliar with the employment terms contained therein. Some unscrupulous employers continue to lure migrant workers to Bahrain and release them illegally in the labor market under the \ufb01free visa\ufb02 scheme\u0160laborers who work for a non-sponsor employer after leaving the employment of the employer who sponsored their entry into the country in violation of the local labor law\u0160thereby rendering them vulnerable to exploitation. Although currently under reform, Bahrain's sponsorship-based employment system continues to put some workers at risk of trafficking by restricting employees' ability to change employers or leave the country, and by giving employers the unilateral power to cancel residency permits. 89BANGLADESH"},"Bangladesh":{"April":3.0,"Asylum Seekers":"68","August":24.0,"December":62.0,"February":3.0,"Friday":30.0,"Global Population":161376.71,"January":4.0,"July":14.0,"June":8.0,"Life Expectancy":72.32,"March":7.0,"May":8.0,"Monday":27.0,"November":20.0,"October":26.0,"Population below $1.90 a day":"14.8","Saturday":32.0,"September":19.0,"Sunday":31.0,"Thursday":28.0,"Tuesday":17.0,"Violence against civilians":198,"Wednesday":33.0,"fatalities":["0","0","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","1","2","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","1","1","1","0","0","1","0","1","1","0","0","1","1","1","1","1","1","0","1","0","1","2","1","0","1","0","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","0","1","0","1","1","1","0","1","1","0","1","1","1","1","1","0","1","0","0","1","1","0","0","0","2","1","0","0","1","0","0","3","1","0","0","0","1","1","0","1","1","2","0","1","0","0","0","1","1","1","7","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","1","1","1","0","0","0","0","0","1","1","1","0","0","0","0","0","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","0","1","1","5","1","1","1","0","0","1","1","1","0","1","0","1","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","1"],"government_effort":"NA","introduction":"  WATCH LISTThe Government of Bangladesh does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. The government demonstrated significant efforts during the reporting period by prosecuting two officials allegedly complicit in human trafficking. The government investigated alleged trafficking crimes against Rohingya refugees and arrested some of the perpetrators, while also establishing humanitarian aid and security that may contribute to the prevention of some trafficking crimes. However, the government did not demonstrate increasing efforts compared to the previous reporting period. Courts convicted only one trafficker in 2017\u0160a decrease from 2016 and a low number compared with the scale of the trafficking problem. Official complicity in trafficking crimes remained a serious problem and the government did not report taking action against some credible allegations. While the government retained a court-order mechanism to refer trafficking victims to rehabilitation services, the government reported referring only one victim to such care in 2017 and it did not have a broader referral mechanism encompassing all relevant stakeholders. The government's protection services, when acquired, were neither designed for trafficking victims' specific needs nor available for adult male victims. While the government maintained labor export agreements with several countries intended to regulate recruitment fees, the government continued to allow high recruitment fees and did not consistently address illegally operating recruitment sub-agents, which left workers vulnerable to trafficking. Therefore Bangladesh remained on Tier 2 Watch List for the second consecutive year.

The 2013 Overseas Employment and Migrants Act (OEMA) criminalized fraudulent recruitment and unlawful recruitment fees; however, the government-set recruitment fees were at rates high enough to render many migrant workers indebted and vulnerable to trafficking. Under the OEMA in 2017, MEWOE suspended or cancelled 29 recruitment agencies' licenses, fined 12 agencies, and sentenced four agents to imprisonment ranging from 15 days to three months for false advertising, trading in visas or work permits, charging fees above the legal maximum, or other violations of the OEMA. MEWOE reported its vigilance task force conducted 14 operations in 2017 against corrupt recruitment and travel agencies, and dalals, illegal and unregulated sub-agents who operated in rural locations and connected prospective migrant workers to licensed employment agencies. The Bangladesh Association of International Recruiting Agencies (BAIRA) acknowledged migrant workers frequently paid dalals fees in addition to the legal amount BAIRA agents charged before the worker began the formal recruitment process. Dalals also directly connected workers to overseas jobs by providing fake visas and other documentation, and in some cases, incorrect information about the migration process and the job in the destination country. Observers stated overseas work placement was determined by a migrant worker's ability to pay for the job, not by skills or abilities, and frequently resulted in workers paying as much as five times above the government's maximum fee level. The government continued to use a number of bilateral labor agreements, in part intended to try to protect Bangladeshi workers abroad. In 2017, the government sent more than half a million workers to Saudi Arabia, approximately 15 percent of whom were female workers, under an agreement that mandated employers cover travel costs and domestic workers be employed by a third party rather than the private households in which they work. However, the agreement did not stipulate the maximum cost or eliminate the processing fee charged to the migrant by recruitment agencies. NGOs reported female migration to Saudi Arabia through irregular channels was as high as three times the official figure and media reported multiple stories of women paying dalals fees for work only to be told by their employer in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states that the employer had \ufb01purchased\ufb02 the woman and she was now subject to forced labor. In the previous reporting period, the governments of Bangladesh and Malaysia began to implement an inter-governmental agreement to facilitate the migration of Bangladeshi workers to Malaysia. The agreement aimed to mitigate the impact of private recruitment agencies' high fees and sometimes unscrupulous practices for an initial 5,300 Bangladeshi workers by removing agents from the migration process. The government continued to require pre-departure training, including safe migration and anti-trafficking components, for some migrant workers, including a 30-day pre-departure training course for female domestic workers which focused on learning practical skills and included modules on trafficking awareness and self-protection. The government provided safe migration information through its 42 district employment and manpower offices and 47 technical training centers. MHA acknowledged the government's 2015-2017 national action plan had not been fully implemented. In partnership with an international organization, the government began drafting its plan for 2018-2022. MHA did not publish its annual report on human trafficking during the reporting period. Some district- and sub-district level counter-trafficking committees allocated funding for coordination and victim support while others were not functioning. The government continued to conduct national awareness campaigns through print media, television, and text message, at times in partnership with NGOs. The government began the process of biometric registration for Rohingya refugees and allowed the UN, international organizations, and foreign governments to provide assistance and protection to the refugees. While some international NGOs that assist Rohingya refugees and work with organized labor reported difficulties in meeting stringent government administrative requirements to get visas and approvals required to carry out programs protecting vulnerable populations from various forms of exploitation, the government allowed other NGOs to extend their ability to stay in the country to continue relief efforts for the Rohingya, including some counter-trafficking efforts. The government allowed the UN and other humanitarian actors to conduct trafficking awareness campaigns in the Rohingya camps. The government deployed security forces to guard and control access to Rohingya camps which may have contributed to the prevention of some trafficking crimes. The government trained military personnel to recognize and prevent trafficking in persons prior to their deployment abroad on international peacekeeping missions and provided anti-trafficking training for its diplomatic personnel. The government did not make efforts to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts or forced labor. Bangladesh is not a party to the 2000 UN TIP Protocol.","prosecution":" The government maintained anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts. The 2012 Prevention and Suppression of Human Trafficking Act (PSHTA) criminalized sex and labor trafficking and prescribed penalties of five years to life imprisonment and a fine of not less than 50,000 Bangladeshi Taka (BDT) ($610). These penalties were sufficiently stringent and, with regard to sex trafficking, commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. In the previous reporting period, the government finalized and disseminated the implementing rules for the PSHTA. The government continued to train police officers through an anti-trafficking module at the police academy. The government also provided in-kind support to international organization- and NGO-run trainings for police and immigration officials. While the government reported 50,780 police officers were trained on human trafficking through a total of 148 programs in 2017, it did not report if police and other relevant officials received training on the PSHTA implementing rules. Various observers stated police officers did not understand human trafficking and, at times, conftated it with migrant smuggling. The government did not report comprehensive data under the same law enforcement actions as in past years, thereby making past data incomparable. In 2017, the government reported 778 cases were recorded with police under the PSHTA, of which 496 remained under investigation at the end of the year. Of the 282 completed investigations, 86 cases were unsubstantiated and 196 cases resulted in charges against the accused, although the government did not report the number of prosecutions initiated during the year nor did it categorize the cases between sex and labor trafficking as it had in the past. In 2016, the government investigated 290 cases\u0160122 sex and 168 labor trafficking cases, 31 of which were specifically investigated for bonded labor\u0160and prosecuted 302 alleged traffickers under the PSHTA. In 2017, the courts reached verdicts in nine cases and convicted one trafficker, compared with three convictions in 2016. The other eight cases resulted in acquittal. The courts sentenced the convicted trafficker to life imprisonment. Observers stated convictions remained rare because the government did not dedicate sufficient resources to pre-trial investigations in all types of cases and prosecutors persisted with trials to meet the statutorily required timeline of 180 working days for the disposal of cases even if they were inadequately prepared. The government also had not established the anti-human trafficking tribunal, stipulated in the PSHTA to specialize in human trafficking cases. The Women and Children Violence Protection Tribunal continued to hear trafficking cases in the interim; however, observers commented the prosecutors were overburdened and lacked expertise in trafficking cases. An NGO expressed concern that some village courts, five-person panels of local government officials and villagers, adjudicated trafficking cases as they only administer financial penalties of up to 75,000 BDT ($915) and may have subjected victims, whose traffickers frequently had local connections, to intimidation, fraud, and corruption. During the reporting period, nearly 700,000 Rohingya, of which over half were women and children, fted Burma to Bangladesh. The government reported it arrested some traffickers attempting to exploit Rohingya refugees, although it did not report specific numbers of alleged traffickers arrested 90BANGLADESHor if they were prosecuted. Media reported the government deployed the Rapid Action Battalion to investigate allegations of trafficking and mobile courts to process legal cases. An international organization trained Bangladeshi law enforcement officers assigned to the refugee camps on the prevention of trafficking and the identification and subsequent protection of victims. Complicity of officials in trafficking offenses remained a serious problem. Observers reported police took bribes and sexual favors to ignore potential trafficking crimes at brothels. Observers accused officials from district employment and manpower offices of facilitating trafficking and some labor attaches, local politicians, judges, and police of requesting bribes from victims and their families. Observers stated some traffickers in rural areas were politically connected and therefore operated with impunity. According to NGOs, some local politicians convinced victims to accept payment from recruitment sub-agents to not report fraudulent or exploitative actions to police. In September 2016, a federal court in New York entered a default judgment against a former Bangladeshi consular officer and his wife and ordered them to pay approximately $920,000 to a Bangladeshi citizen in a civil suit in which the plaintiff alleged violations of the TVPA as well as federal and state labor laws. The consular officer left the United States and remained in the Bangladeshi foreign service as an ambassador. The default judgment remained unpaid while the case was on appeal. During the reporting period, the plaintiff alleged experiencing retaliatory actions by the Bangladesh Consulate in New York. In another case, in June 2017, a Bangladeshi consular officer was indicted in a New York court on charges of labor trafficking and assault for allegedly forcing a Bangladeshi citizen to work without pay through threats and intimidation. In January 2018, the consular officer pled guilty to the charge of failure to pay a minimum wage and paid $10,000 in restitution to the victim. The government did not report taking any action during the reporting period to hold either consular officer accountable. The government reported that two government officials were investigated and prosecuted under the PSHTA in 2017 but did not provide further details of the case; the prosecution remained ongoing at the end of the reporting period. ","protection":" The government maintained victim protection efforts. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), the government's lead agency for combating trafficking, had standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the proactive identification of trafficking victims; however, the government did not report how widely officials disseminated or used these SOPs. Some police officers used a checklist to proactively identify victims when they came into contact with commercial sex establishments; however, the government did not formally adopt or disseminate the checklist and its use was inconsistent. The government did not report victim identification data based on substantiated cases of trafficking as it had in the past, thereby making past data incomparable. The government reported 770 potential victims based on the number of cases recorded with police in 2017; of those identified, 383 were men, 258 women, and 129 children. The government identified 355; 1,815; and 2,899 victims in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively; experts commented the decrease from thousands of victims identified in 2015 and 2014 may be due in part to the application of a more accurate definition of trafficking. Police directly recovered from exploitative situations 545 of the 770 potential victims identified in 2017. NGOs and international organizations reported identifying more than one thousand victims during the reporting period. Notably, one international organization identified 37 Rohingya victims who were subjected to trafficking within Bangladesh and provided them rehabilitation services. The Bangladesh Army and Rapid Action Battalion reportedly were active in the identification of potential Rohingya victims of trafficking. While the government did not provide services specifically designed for trafficking victims, the Bangladesh Police operated victim support centers in each of Bangladesh's eight divisions for women and children victims of violence, including trafficking victims. The centers provided temporary shelter for up to five days and medical and psychological counseling. With partial funding from a foreign government, the Ministry of Social Welfare (MSW) operated one-stop crisis centers at medical facilities for women and children victims of violence, including trafficking victims, to provide shelter, medical care, psychological counseling, and referral to other services, including legal assistance and police for case filing. MSW operated nine one-stop crisis centers at the divisional level and 40 smaller centers at the district and 40 at the sub-district levels. The government did not provide shelter or rehabilitation services, other than repatriation and job placement, to adult male victims. Foreign victims were not provided access to government services. While the government retained a court-order mechanism to refer trafficking victims to rehabilitation services, it did not have a broader referral mechanism to refer victims to rehabilitation services. In 2017, the government reported referring only one victim to government or NGO-run services and reported all other victims were returned directly to their families. Some NGOs reported the government referred victims to them for rehabilitation during the reporting period, but such referrals were ad hoc and the government did not track victim care in a systematic way. NGOs provided male victims with some services, although shelter was not available. NGOs continued to state government services did not meet minimum standards of care and insufficient rehabilitation resources contributed to victims being re-trafficked. Government shelters did not allow victims to leave without a court order and a court order was also required for NGOs or international organizations to be able to contact victims in government shelters to provide further rehabilitation services. The government continued to implement its 2015 memorandum of understanding with the Government of India on human trafficking, which included coordination on the rescue and repatriation of Bangladeshi victims. In practice, NGOs reported the Bangladeshi government sometimes provided only the necessary travel documents for repatriation. NGOs or the victim's family frequently paid the cost of repatriation from India and other countries and at times this resulted in family members incurring burdensome debt. The government continued to operate one safe house in Lebanon, one in Oman, and three in Saudi Arabia for female Bangladeshi workers fteeing abusive employers. The government maintained 29 labor offices in embassies and consulates overseas to provide welfare services to Bangladeshi migrant workers, including legal and interpretation services. Overseas Bangladeshi workers who secured their employment through the Bureau for Manpower, Education, and Training (MEWOE), could lodge complaints with MEWOE to seek restitution for labor and recruitment violations, including allegations of forced labor, through an arbitration process, although observers stated the awards were often minimal. MEWOE reported 344 complaints were settled from July 2016 to June 2017 through the recovery of 297,300 BDT ($3,630) from recruiting agencies; it did not report if any of these complaints involved forced labor. Victims could also file civil suits seeking restitution. 91BANGLADESHThe PSHTA entitled victims to protection during judicial proceedings, including police security. The government did not report if it provided such protection to victims during the reporting period and NGOs noted insufficient implementation of this provision resulted in traffickers intimidating victims not to pursue cases. NGOs reported some Bangladeshi trafficking victims who transited through various land and sea routes, instead of being detected as victims, were detained and fined for failure to carry a passport. Unregistered Rohingya refugees, including potential trafficking victims, may have been at risk of indefinite detention because of their lack of documentation. The government did not provide legal alternatives to the removal of foreign victims of trafficking to countries where they might face hardship or retribution. ","recommendation":"Take steps to eliminate recruitment fees charged to workers by licensed labor recruiters and ensure they are paid by employers; increase prosecutions and convictions, particularly of labor traffickers, fraudulent labor recruiters, and complicit government officials, while strictly respecting due process; proactively incorporate forced labor and sex trafficking prevention measures into the response to the Rohingya refugee crisis; increase investigations and prosecutions of credible allegations of trafficking of Rohingya; establish guidelines for provision of adequate victim care and standard operating procedures for the referral of victims to such services; enhance the training provided to officials, including law enforcement, labor inspectors, and immigration officers, on methods to identify trafficking cases and refer victims to protection services; expand the support services available to victims, including adult male victims, within Bangladesh and at Bangladesh's embassies abroad; expand the Ministry of Expatriate Welfare and Overseas Employment's (MEWOE) mandate to include the regulation of sub-agents; improve quality of pre-departure trainings, including sessions on labor rights, labor laws, and methods to access justice and assistance in destination countries and Bangladesh; complete the draft 2018-2022 National Plan of Action (NPA) and allocate funding to and identify a senior governmental official to facilitate the implementation of the NPA; and accede to the 2000 UN TIP Protocol.","tier":"TIER 2","traffick_profile":"As reported over the past five years, Bangladesh is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking. Some Bangladeshi men and women who migrate willingly to work in the Middle East, Southern and East Africa, South and Southeast Asia, Europe, and the United States face conditions indicative of forced labor. Before their departure, many migrant workers assume debt to pay high recruitment fees, imposed legally by recruitment agencies belonging to BAIRA and illegally by unlicensed sub-agents; this places migrant workers at risk of debt bondage. Some recruitment agencies and agents also commit recruitment fraud, including contract switching, in which they promise one type of job and conditions but then change the job, employer, conditions, or salary after arrival. Women and girls who migrate for domestic work are particularly vulnerable to abuse. Some women who migrate through Bangladeshi recruitment agencies to Lebanon or Jordan for domestic work are sold and transported to Syria and subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking. Some women and children are subjected to 92BARBADOSsex trafficking and forced labor in India and Pakistan. With nearly 700,000 Rohingya fteeing Burma for Bangladesh since August 2017, Bangladesh is host to more than 1 million undocumented Rohingya, including hundreds of thousands who fted Burma in previous decades. The Rohingya community's stateless status and inability to work legally increases their vulnerability to human trafficking. Rohingya women and girls are reportedly recruited from refugee camps for domestic work in private homes, guest houses, or hotels and are instead subjected to sex trafficking. Rohingya girls are also reportedly transported within Bangladesh to Chittagong and Dhaka and transnationally to Kathmandu and Kolkata and subjected to sex trafficking\u0160some of these girls are \ufb01traded\ufb02 between traffickers over the internet. Some Rohingya women and girls report being subjected to sex trafficking by other Rohingya through fraudulent job or marriage proposals. Rohingya girls and boys are recruited from refugee camps to work as shop hands, fishermen, rickshaw pullers, and domestic workers in Bangladesh. Although promised monthly wages ranging from 1,500-2,000 BDT ($18-$24), these children are paid significantly less or not at all and in most cases are not allowed to communicate with their families and are subjected to excessive working hours. Some Rohingya men are subjected to debt bondage by Bangladeshi fishermen if they place their shelter on the fishermen's land. Some Rohingya men who fted to Bangladesh from Burma decades ago have been trapped in debt bondage to Bangladeshi fishermen for 20 years. In the recent past, some Rohingya and Bangladeshi migrants who traveled by boat to Southeast Asian countries were subjected to exploitation when they were unable to pay ransoms and were instead sold into forced labor.Within the country, Bangladeshi children and adults are subjected to sex trafficking, domestic servitude, and forced and bonded labor, in which traffickers exploit an initial debt assumed by a worker as part of the employment terms. Street children are sometimes coerced into criminality or forced to beg; begging ringmasters sometimes maim children to increase their earnings. In some instances, children are sold into a form of bondage by their parents, while others are induced into labor through fraud and physical coercion, including in fisheries, domestic work, aluminum factories, and garment and dry-fish production, or exploited in sex trafficking. Bangladeshi children are vulnerable to forced labor in tanneries. According to an international expert on debt bondage, Bangladeshi families and Indian migrant workers are subjected to bonded labor in some of Bangladesh's brick kilns; some kiln owners sell bonded females into prostitution purportedly to recoup the families' debts and some Bangladeshi families are subjected to debt bondage in shrimp farming. Some ethnic Indian families are forced to work in the tea industry in the northeastern part of the country. NGOs allege some officials allow human traffickers to operate at brothels, at India-Bangladesh border crossings, and at maritime embarkation points."},"Belarus":{"April":0.0,"Asylum Seekers":"3","August":0.0,"December":0.0,"February":1.0,"Friday":1.0,"Global Population":9452.62,"January":0.0,"July":1.0,"June":1.0,"Life Expectancy":74.59,"March":1.0,"May":2.0,"Monday":1.0,"November":0.0,"October":0.0,"Population below $1.90 a day":"0","Saturday":2.0,"September":1.0,"Sunday":2.0,"Thursday":0.0,"Tuesday":0.0,"Violence against civilians":7,"Wednesday":1.0,"fatalities":["0","0","0","0","0","0","0"],"government_effort":"NA","introduction":"The Government of Belarus does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so; therefore Belarus remained on Tier 3.

However, the government maintained policies that actively compelled the forced labor of its citizens, including civil 94BELARUSservants, students, part-time workers, and the unemployed, citizens suffering from drug or alcohol dependency, and, at times, critics of the government, among others.

The young men reportedly threatened their victims with violence, beat them up, douse them with an antiseptic green dye and filmed the abuse. A group of 11 teenagers resident in Homel and the Homel region have been given suspended prison sentences ranging from one to two years for violence and bullying against gay men. On June 30th 2018, near Krupki, several youngsters were forced to kneel with their hands above their heads in the rain for more than five hours after police raided an anarchist event. Later, Mikalai Dziadok, an activist of an anarchist group, complained about the abuse to the district department of the Investigative Committee. On May 21st 2018, in Mogilev, a journalist Alina Skarbunova has been abducted by plainclothes people who later were confirmed as police. The abduction and further detention was caused by alleged cooperation of the freelance journalist with BelSAT independent media service.

The government conducted public awareness campaigns through television, radio, and print media, and provided 95BELGIUMin-kind assistance to anti-trafficking NGOs in the form of advertising hotlines, production assistance, and placement of awareness-raising materials on state-owned television, radio, and billboards. The interior ministry continued to operate a hotline for safe travel abroad to inform potential labor migrants and identify illegal recruitment practices; the hotline received 1,166 calls for consultations in 2017. The government did not investigate or file charges related to illegal recruitment in 2017, compared to 50 companies charged in 2016; forced labor regulations were seldom enforced, and resources and inspections dedicated to preventing forced and compulsory labor were minimal and inadequate to deter violations. The government adopted the 2017-2019 State Program on Countering Crime and Corruption, which included anti-trafficking activities, in May 2017. The government reported efforts to reduce the demand for commercial sex.","prosecution":"The government's law enforcement efforts remained weak. Article 181 of the criminal code criminalized all forms of labor trafficking and some forms of sex trafficking and prescribed penalties ranging from five to seven years imprisonment and forfeiture of assets, which were sufficiently stringent and, with regard to sex trafficking, commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. Inconsistent with international law, Article 181 required a demonstration of force, fraud, or coercion to constitute a child sex trafficking offense, and therefore did not criminalize all forms of child sex trafficking. The government reported one sex trafficking investigation in 2017 under article 181, compared with one in 2016, one in 2015, one in 2014, and six in 2013. Authorities initiated one investigation under article 181-1, which criminalized the use of forced labor, compared with no cases in 2016 and one in 2015. The Main Department for Drug Control and Combating Trafficking in Human Beings led law enforcement efforts and reported 69 officers directly involved in combating and investigating trafficking and related offenses. The government did not convict any traffickers under article 181; the last conviction was in 2012. Authorities prosecuted three individuals for potential child sex trafficking offenses under other articles in the criminal code in 2017, compared with four individuals in 2016 and six in 2015. The government did not report any investigations, prosecutions, or convictions of government employees complicit in trafficking offenses. The interior ministry's law enforcement academy continued to provide trafficking-specific training to Belarusian law enforcement and NGO officials.","protection":"The government maintained victim protection efforts. The government identified two confirmed and 129 potential trafficking victims during law enforcement investigations, compared with 184 confirmed and potential victims in 2016 and 121 in 2015. Of the 131 confirmed and potential victims the government identified in 2017, 127 victims, including 26 children, were sexually exploited. The government reported referring 60 victims to NGOs for reintegration services, compared with 55 in 2016 and 27 in 2015. NGOs reported law enforcement officials referred 134 victims to international organizations and NGOs for care, compared with 27 in 2015 and 32 in 2014; NGOs stated this increase was due to improved cooperation with law enforcement across the country. The government reported training police officers and diplomats on victim identification and referral procedures. According to a GRETA report, authorities did not identify some victims who had initially consented to perform a certain job or service in which they were later exploited; identification procedures did not specify the consent of victims was irrelevant when there was the presence of force, fraud, or coercion. The government reported screening individuals arrested for prostitution for trafficking indicators and exempting them from any legal liability; the government reported that of the 1,298 individuals convicted on prostitution charges in 2017, none were trafficking victims. The government provided in-kind assistance to anti-trafficking NGOs in the form of facilities for seminars, conferences, and training; expedited approval of projects and grants; and tax-exempt status. The government did not provide financial support for NGOs. NGOs reported assisting 137 trafficking victims in 2017, 22 of whom were children, compared with 279 victims assisted in 2016. An international organization providing victim services experienced a six-month gap in anti-trafficking program funding due to a lapse of international donor funding, which resulted in fewer identifications. The government did not have trafficking-specific facilities available to care for victims, but local authorities operated 128 \ufb01crisis rooms\ufb02 that offered temporary shelter, including beds, meals, and personal hygiene products to vulnerable adults, including victims of natural and manmade disasters, domestic violence, and human trafficking. In 2017, the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare, which monitored \ufb01crisis rooms\ufb02 operations, adopted a new regulation that allowed victims seeking immediate assistance to shelter at a \ufb01crisis room\ufb02 without a form of identification. The hours of operation were expanded from weekdays only to 24-hours a day. The government reported that three trafficking victims used these facilities.In previous years, observers reported most victims sought assistance at private shelters because the government's centers were poorly equipped and lacked qualified caregivers. The education ministry maintained centers that could provide vulnerable children with shelter and basic provisions; however, similar to past years, no child trafficking victims had received services at these facilities, despite the government identifying child sex trafficking victims. The government reported providing medical care and information to 45 potential trafficking victims. ","recommendation":"Reform state policies to end all forms of state-sponsored forced labor, including repealing presidential decrees and other laws that result in the unemployed, civil servants, students, and citizens suffering from drug or alcohol dependency, among others, being subjected to forced labor; amend the criminal code to remove the possibility of forced labor as a penalty for political dissent; significantly increase efforts to investigate and prosecute cases of forced labor and sex trafficking; amend article 181 to include exploiting children younger than 18 to engage in commercial sex as a trafficking crime, regardless of evidence of coercion, as prescribed by international law; increase resources devoted to trafficking victim assistance and protection within Belarus, including for state-owned territorial centers for social services and for NGOs; provide child sex trafficking victims with services specialized to their needs and refer all identified victims to care facilities; train all relevant officials on the national identification and referral mechanism; proactively screen all individuals in prostitution for indicators of trafficking; and increase labor inspections to identify internal forced labor.","tier":"TIER 3","traffick_profile":"As reported over the past five years, Belarus is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to sex trafficking and forced labor. Data collected by NGOs suggests the majority of trafficking victims are men subjected to labor exploitation, primarily in Russia. Belarusian victims are primarily subjected to trafficking in Russia and Belarus, as well as in Poland, Turkey, and other countries in Eurasia and the Middle East. Some Belarusian women traveling for foreign employment in the adult entertainment and hotel industries are subjected to sex trafficking. The government has identified Belarusian, Moldovan, Russian, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese victims exploited in Belarus.State-sponsored forced labor continues to be an area of concern, and the UNHRC adopted a resolution in July 2015 expressing deep concern at the government's \ufb01violations of labor rights amounting to forced labor,\ufb02 among other human rights issues. In January 2018 the government rescinded Presidential Decree Number 3, the so-called \ufb01parasite tax,\ufb02 which required unemployed persons to pay a fee to the state or potentially face compulsory community service. Presidential Decree Number 1 was simultaneously adopted with the rescindment of Decree Number 3. According to media reports, the president described Decree Number 1 as intended to \ufb01help people find employment while forcing the unemployed who are unwilling to work into jobs.\ufb02 The new presidential decree will be fully enforced on January 1, 2019. In June 2016, the government repealed a 2012 decree preventing state workers in wood processing from leaving their jobs without employer approval and subjecting them to significant fines; failure to pay those fines placed employees at risk of having to work under law enforcement supervision. The ILO Committee of Experts reported a 2010 law allows for Belarusians suffering from alcoholism or drug dependencies to be \ufb01interned in \u201amedical labor centers' for a period of 12 to 18 months and have an obligation to work; refusing to work results in punishment, such as solitary confinement, for up to ten days.\ufb02 As of June 2015, an estimated 6,700 people were held at these centers. The government continued the practice of subbotniks, which requires employees of the government, state enterprises, and many private businesses to work on occasional Saturdays and donate their earnings to finance government projects. The UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Belarus reported repercussions for non-participation in subbotniks, including non-renewal of employment contracts and the revocation of monthly bonuses. State employers and authorities also intimidate and fine some workers who refused to participate. Authorities require university and high school students to help farmers during the harvesting season without paying them for their labors, in addition to other forced community service projects. Authorities reportedly force military conscripts to perform work unrelated to military service. Per a 2006 presidential decree, parents who have had their parental rights removed are subjected to compulsory labor, and the government retains 70 percent of their wages. The ILO Committee of Experts noted its deep concern in 2016 that some provisions of the Belarusian criminal code, which included forced labor as possible punishment, are worded broadly enough to lend themselves to application as a means of punishment for the expression of views opposed to the government. The ILO Committee of Experts cited reports that the government used or threatened to use arbitrary detention involving compulsory labor for apparently political motives."},"Benin":{"April":1.0,"Asylum Seekers":"1","August":2.0,"December":0.0,"February":5.0,"Friday":1.0,"Global Population":11485.04,"January":0.0,"July":3.0,"June":2.0,"Life Expectancy":61.47,"March":1.0,"May":0.0,"Monday":1.0,"November":0.0,"October":0.0,"Population below $1.90 a day":"49.5","Saturday":6.0,"September":0.0,"Sunday":4.0,"Thursday":1.0,"Tuesday":0.0,"Violence against civilians":14,"Wednesday":1.0,"fatalities":["1","0","0","1","7","0","2","5","0","1","0","1","4","0"],"government_effort":"NA","introduction":"The Government of Benin does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so.

The government demonstrated increasing efforts by prosecuting and convicting more child traffickers, identifying more child trafficking victims, and establishing formal procedures for the identification and referral of children vulnerable to abuse, including trafficking. The government introduced screening procedures at airports to identify adult victims traveling abroad and increased coordination with neighboring countries to prevent transnational trafficking of adults, resulting in the identification of 16 potential adult victims. The government established a formal inter-ministerial committee and developed a national action plan to address all types of trafficking\u0160including adults\u0160in collaboration with NGOs and international organizations. However, the government did not meet the minimum standards in several key areas. Current laws do not explicitly criminalize the trafficking of adults and provisions in the revised draft penal code, which would have addressed this omission, remained pending in the National Assembly. Deficiencies in the legal framework resulted in judges dismissing cases or reducing charges in adult trafficking cases. The government made limited efforts to identify adult victims or refer them to services.","iso3":"BEN","latitude":["7.1783","8.4942","9.4996","10.5877","10.5877","10.6212","7.0385","7.3633","6.9801","6.8596","7.0676","7.0676","7.0676","6.9801"],"location":["Bohicon","Ouesse","Onklou","Tchamonga","Tchamonga","Tanguieta","Igana","Ketou","Pobe","Atchonsa","Agbangnizoun","Agbangnizoun","Agbangnizoun","Pobe"],"longitude":["2.0667","2.4228","1.9847","0.8127","0.8127","1.2665","2.6928","2.5998","2.6649","2.4631","1.9737","1.9737","1.9737","2.6649"],"notes":"On August 25th, a man was killed in Honmeho, Bohicon municipality.

In September 2017, the government established an inter-ministerial committee to coordinate national anti-trafficking efforts, chaired by the chief of staff of the minister of planning and development and composed of directors of offices from across the Beninese government and partners from key NGOs and international organizations. The committee met twice during the reporting period; worked with the Ministry of Justice and the National Assembly to incorporate anti-trafficking provisions into the draft penal code; developed a national action plan to combat trafficking that explicitly included adults; and in November 2017, convened a summit involving law enforcement, NGOs, representatives from all 21 government ministries and international organizations. In July 2017, MSAM launched a public awareness campaign, in partnership with an international organization, which highlighted potential exploitation within Benin's main open-air markets (Dantokpa in Cotonou, Ouando in Porto-Novo, and Arzeke in Parakou). This campaign incorporated an inspection program conducted at the markets and along roads connecting major cities, which resulted in the identification of more than 800 potential child trafficking victims. The government made no discernible efforts to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts or forced labor.The government increased coordination with neighboring countries on airport screening procedures for adults and, in 2017, assisted in the interception of 14 Beninese women en route to the Middle East for potentially exploitative work, facilitating reunifications with their families in Benin. In November 2017, the government started the Administrative Census for the Identification of the Population, an effort to collect data on all Beninese citizens from birth, in order to create a national digital database and issue national biometric identification cards. A lack of identity documentation continued to be a contributing factor to increased vulnerability to trafficking across West Africa, and in Benin. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has a code of conduct for diplomats that prohibited Beninese nationals deployed abroad from engaging in or facilitating trafficking in persons; however, the government did not report providing anti-trafficking training for its diplomatic personnel.","prosecution":"The government increased its law enforcement efforts to address child trafficking, but demonstrated lesser efforts to combat the trafficking of adults. Existing laws criminalized some forms of labor and sex trafficking. The 2006 Act Relating to the Transportation of Minors and the Suppression of Child Trafficking (Act 2006-04) criminalized child labor and sex trafficking. Article 21 of Act 2006-04 prescribed penalties of 10 to 20 years for sex trafficking of children, which were sufficiently stringent and commensurate with those for other serious crimes, such as rape. Article 22 of Act 2006-04 prescribed penalties of six months to two years imprisonment and a fine for forced child labor, which were not sufficiently stringent. Article 3 of the labor code criminalized forced labor of adults and prescribed punishments of two months to one year imprisonment or a fine, which were not sufficiently stringent. Article 334 of the penal code did not explicitly criminalize adult sex trafficking; however, it criminalized procuring or offering a person for prostitution and the facilitation of prostitution with penalties of six months to two years imprisonment. The National Assembly did not review anti-trafficking legislation that had been pending for five years; however, the inter-ministerial committee began work with the National Assembly to incorporate anti-trafficking provisions into the draft penal code, which remained pending at the end of the reporting period. In 2017, OCPM\u0160a specialized unit responsible for anti-trafficking enforcement\u0160investigated 30 suspected child traffickers\u0160compared with 48 child abuse cases that may have included trafficking\u0160involving 66 suspects in 2016. Six of the 14 First Instance Courts reported prosecuting and convicting 13 child traffickers in 2017, compared with prosecuting six suspected child traffickers and zero convictions in 2016. The courts convicted three offenders for child sex trafficking, four for illegal transport of children, and six for child trafficking under Act 2006-04 on the displacement of minors and prevention of child trafficking. The government did not investigate or prosecute any trafficking cases involving adult victims or take action against potential illegal recruitment agencies. Judges reported dismissing adult trafficking cases or reducing the charges given the lack of a specific law criminalizing adult trafficking. The government did not report any investigations, prosecutions, or convictions of government officials complicit in human trafficking offenses. In April 2017, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Microfinance (MSAM), in partnership with an international organization, trained 23 prosecutors and judges, 17 border officials, eight police officers, and two ministry officials on migrant smuggling, human trafficking, and victim identification and protection. In October, a prosecutor provided anti-trafficking training to an unknown number of unit chiefs from the Port of Cotonou's Joint Unit for Container Control, Maritime Gendarmerie, Gendarmerie Investigative Bureau, Benin Drug Investigative Unit, Customs units, Water and Forest Police, and the airport's anti-trafficking unit. ","protection":"The government increased efforts to protect child trafficking victims and made limited efforts to identify and assist adult victims. During the reporting period, the government identified and referred 370 potential child trafficking victims to OCPM for initial care, compared with 223 in the previous reporting period. OCPM officers and the police proactively identified potential child victims through patrols of high-risk areas such as borders, bus stations, and large markets. In February 2018, the Ministry of Interior, in partnership with an international organization, sought to harmonize OCPM, civil society, and police efforts by establishing formal standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the referral of vulnerable children, including potential victims of trafficking, to protective services. Prior to adoption of the formal SOPs, MSAM, OCPM, the ministries of justice and foreign affairs, international organizations, and NGOs developed a system to assist, repatriate, and reintegrate victims of child trafficking. As part of this process, OCPM assumed initial custody of child trafficking victims in Benin and provided temporary shelter in its Cotonou facility that could house up to 160 children (80 boys and 80 girls). 100BHUTANThe OCPM shelter offered child victims legal, medical, and psychological assistance, and served as a transit facility for potential child trafficking victims while their cases were processed prior to placement in long-term shelters. After an OCPM interview and assessment, victims were referred to a network of NGO shelters throughout the country. Trafficking-specific services were not available for adult victims, although they received care under the auspices of programs to assist victims of other forms of abuse. In January 2018, government officials at Cotonou airport identified two Ghanaian women traveling to potentially exploitative conditions, interviewed them, and worked with the Ghanaian embassy to ensure safe repatriation.OCPM assisted foreign trafficking victims, predominantly minors, before repatriating them to their home countries. The government conducted repatriations of foreign victims in conjunction with an international NGO and the assistance of embassies or consulates of victims' countries of origin. During the reporting period, the government maintained support for OCPM's anti-trafficking work by contributing 19.2 million West African CFA francs (FCFA) ($34,140). This support included services for all children received in its shelter, including trafficking victims. The bilateral anti-trafficking cooperation agreement to facilitate law enforcement data sharing and repatriation coordination between Benin and Gabon remained pending, and no actions were taken under the 2011 Cooperation Agreement between Benin and the Republic of the Congo. Multilateral anti-trafficking cooperation agreements to increase law enforcement coordination on child trafficking cases between Benin, Togo, and Nigeria remained pending as well. Beninese law did not provide legal alternatives to removal of trafficking victims to countries in which victims would face retribution or hardship, although cases involving foreign child trafficking victims were considered on an ad hoc basis.","recommendation":"Enact legislation to criminalize all forms of trafficking consistent with the 2000 UN TIP Protocol; increase efforts to investigate, prosecute, convict, and adequately sentence offenders of sex and labor trafficking of adults and children, including illegal labor recruiters; develop systematic procedures for proactive victim identification\u0160particularly of adults and victims of forced labor\u0160and their subsequent referral to care; train law enforcement officials on identification and referral procedures; increase funding to the Central Office for the Protection of Minors (OCPM) to provide adequate support to victims, including adults; improve efforts to collect law enforcement data on trafficking offenses and victim identifications, including adults; finalize the pending bilateral agreement with Gabon and multilateral agreements with Togo, Burkina Faso, and Nigeria to increase information sharing and cooperation on international trafficking investigations; use the 2011 bilateral anti-trafficking agreement with the Republic of The Congo to increase law enforcement coordination; and expand the OCPM's child trafficking database to include adult trafficking victims. ","tier":"TIER 2","traffick_profile":"Benin is a country of origin, transit, and destination for women and children subjected to trafficking in persons, primarily for forced labor and sex trafficking. Trafficking victims most often come from low-income families, and frequently lack formal education or basic identity documents including birth certificates and national identification. Internal trafficking primarily draws children from rural areas in the north to the urban south of Benin in search of economic opportunity. International organizations and NGOs reported that marabouts continue to exploit children (talibes), especially in the northern regions of the country. Rising unemployment leads young girls to seek work abroad where they are at risk of sexual exploitation. Children from Benin who are subjected to trafficking externally are transported to West and Central African countries. Some parents send children to wealthier families for educational or vocational opportunities; a practice called vidomegon. Some of these children are subjected to domestic servitude. Children from neighboring countries are forced to labor on farms, in commercial agriculture (particularly in the cotton sector), in artisanal mines, at construction sites, or as street or market vendors in Benin. The department of Oueme in southeast Benin was reportedly a primary area of recruitment for child trafficking victims subsequently exploited in the Republic of the Congo. Benin is the largest source country for trafficking victims in the Republic of the Congo. Traffickers exploit West African women in domestic servitude and forced commercial sex in Benin. There are increasing reports that young Beninese women are subjected to trafficking in Middle Eastern countries where they work as domestic help and are often forced into commercial sex. Traffickers and their accomplices continue to send child victims to their destinations alone and then meet the victims upon arrival, which makes investigations more challenging. International organizations report that potentially vulnerable adults now use airports in neighboring countries in order to circumnavigate anti-trafficking screening procedures put in place by the government at the International Airport of Cotonou.

However, the government did not meet the minimum standards in several key areas. All sentences imposed on convicted traffickers were below the minimum penalties set forth in the 2008 anti-trafficking law. The government did not adequately fund the police anti-trafficking unit or protective services, nor did it make efforts to address child forced begging by unscrupulous marabouts (religious instructors) in Quranic schools.

The Ministry of Women, National Solidarity, and Family led the national anti-trafficking committee, which coordinated government anti-trafficking efforts. The committee met once during the reporting period but continued to lack the resources to plan future initiatives or take proactive measures to combat trafficking. The hybrid government-NGO working group for child protection functioned more effectively, so the government used this body to coordinate and share information on child protection and child trafficking issues. The anti-trafficking committee had sub-committees at the regional, provincial, and departmental levels to coordinate locally; subcommittees were composed of police, social workers, transit companies, NGOs, and other regional stakeholders, and they coordinated administrative efforts to support anti-trafficking law enforcement activities and victim protection and collected anti-trafficking data for the national committee's annual report. These groups, also responsible for intercepting traffickers and identifying victims, lacked resources for day-to-day operations, and the government did not report how many groups met during the reporting period. The government did not report allocating any funding to these committees, compared to allocating 300,000 FCFA ($530) to each of the 24 networks in the previous reporting period. Despite the existence of the various anti-trafficking committees and child protection working groups, inter-governmental communication on anti-trafficking issues remained lacking and inhibited progress. The government BURKINA FASO115did not have or begin drafting an anti-trafficking national action plan. Some regional and provincial directorates of the Ministry of Women, National Solidarity, and Family organized awareness-raising campaigns on the signs and dangers of trafficking and child labor. The government identified and removed children from mining through its 2015-2019 national program to combat child labor in artisanal mines, although the government did not devote any funding or resources to implement other tenets of the plan. The Ministry of Women, National Solidarity, and Family continued to provide monitoring services and assistance to 20,000 freed child miners to reduce their vulnerability to additional child or forced child labor. The government continued to operate a hotline to report cases of violence against children, including trafficking, and allocated 4 million FCFA ($7,110) to the hotline during the reporting period. The hotline operated during weekdays and did not receive any reports of trafficking during the reporting period. Unlike previous years, the government did not allocate any funding for vocational training for the social reintegration of young street children vulnerable to trafficking.The government did not report any policies to prevent the fraudulent recruitment or exploitation of Burkinabes abroad, despite reports that such exploitation occurred. The Labor Inspectorate increased its number of labor inspectors from 154 to 169 during the reporting period, all of whom received basic training on child labor laws, although it did not report the number of inspections carried out or any child labor violations detected. The government did not make any efforts to reduce the demand for forced labor or commercial sex acts. The government did not report providing anti-trafficking training to its diplomatic personnel. The government, in partnership with foreign donors, provided Burkinabe troops with anti-trafficking training prior to their deployment abroad as part of international peacekeeping missions. ","prosecution":"The government increased law enforcement efforts. The 2008 anti-trafficking law criminalized labor and sex trafficking and prescribed penalties of five to 10 years imprisonment, which were sufficiently stringent and, with respect to sex trafficking, commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. The government began revising its penal code to increase the terms of imprisonment for human trafficking crimes from five to eleven years; the revisions were awaiting approval from the Council of Ministers at the end of the reporting period.For the first time in two years, the government reported data on anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts. Between March 2016 and March 2018, 25 courts investigated, prosecuted, and convicted 61 traffickers. Courts reported data in different formats, so it was unclear exactly how many additional investigations and prosecutions were ongoing at the end of the reporting period. This was a significant increase from the previous reporting period, when the government reported 78 investigations but did not report data on prosecutions or convictions. Among the 61 convictions, 16 traffickers received prison sentences of between three months and three years imprisonment. Judges sentenced 45 traffickers to either a fine or a suspended sentence, which was inconsistent with the penalties prescribed in the 2008 anti-trafficking law. The government did not report if it continued to investigate the 78 investigations pending at the close of the previous reporting period, including investigations into debt bondage, forced begging in Quranic schools, sex trafficking, and the fraudulent recruitment of more than 47 women for domestic servitude in various Middle Eastern countries. While at least one court from all 13 administrative regions reported data, the courts that reported data only represented 25 of 45 sub-regional provinces. The government did not report any investigations, prosecutions, or convictions for forced begging in Quranic schools, despite the prevalence of this form of trafficking in the country. Due to a lack of funds, the police did not complete any investigations into child forced labor in artisanal mines, despite reports of exploitative child labor. The government did not report any investigations, prosecutions, or convictions of government officials complicit in human trafficking offenses; however, corruption remained a concern. Authorities alleged some officials exerted pressure over police and judiciary to drop labor trafficking cases, especially in the mining sector. An international donor provided anti-trafficking BURKINA FASO114training for some law enforcement officials. The government did not provide funding to police specifically for anti-trafficking activities, which impeded law enforcement and security forces' investigation of trafficking offenses.","protection":"The government increased efforts to identify trafficking victims. With data from all 45 provinces, the government reported identifying 1,740 trafficking victims, an increase from 1,407 potential victims identified in 40 provinces the previous reporting period. Among the victims identified, the government reported Nigerian girls in sex trafficking within Burkina Faso and Burkinabes exploited abroad in forced labor in Libya and sex trafficking in Lebanon. This is a contrast from previous years, when the government primarily identified Burkinabe and West African children intercepted while being transported, sometimes in large numbers on trucks or buses, to destinations where they could have faced exploitation, typically in gold mines or in city centers as domestic servants or street beggars. The government also identified and removed 1,284 child laborers from 86 artisanal gold mining sites in six provinces, some of whom might have been trafficking victims, and provided food, clothing, shelter, health care, and legal assistance to 25 of these children. An international organization provided assistance and repatriation to 22 additional female sex trafficking victims from Nigeria, some of whom the government had identified and referred to the organization for care. A second NGO identified 12 Malian girls in domestic servitude and provided care. The government had standard victim identification and referral procedures; in regions where authorities and front-line responders had been trained, such procedures worked efficiently. In addition, the government validated and disseminated throughout the country a case management guide for law enforcement and social services personnel to facilitate the uniform referral of child victims of crime, including trafficking, to care, and distributed 1,000 copies of a children's rights guide to social service actors to improve their knowledge of the care options available for vulnerable children. The government operated and staffed one shelter in Ouagadougou; the shelter was open 24 hours per day and could accommodate long-term stays for both adults and children; the government referred 250 trafficking victims to the shelter during the reporting period, and they received shelter, food, and medical assistance. Outside of the capital, the government operated 35 regional protection offices that could provide psychological, social, and food assistance. These offices provided short-term services, but usually not shelter, to at least 108 Burkinabe and foreign child trafficking victims; the offices only operated during weekly business hours and when they had sufficient funding. The government and NGOs disbursed 61 million West African CFA francs (FCFA) ($108,480) to these offices during the reporting period for health care, education, vocational training, family reunification, and social workers; this was in addition to the funding the government provided for the shelter and office staffs' salaries. The protection offices relied heavily on local NGOs and international organizations for the majority of support. When trafficking victims outside of Ouagadougou required shelter, authorities and NGOs nearly always placed victims with host families or an NGO. Outside of Ouagadougou, there were no shelters or services specifically for adults; however, the government shelter and regional protection offices could accommodate adults when necessary. Long-term care for all victims remained inadequate. The government acknowledged victim services were insufficient, and service providers lacked the funding and resources to support victim protection, rehabilitation and reintegration, which resulted in many victims being subjected to re-trafficking. The 2015 law on the prevention and repression of violence against women and girls mandated measures for victim support, including the establishment of free emergency integrated support centers to offer comprehensive support services for women and girl victims of violence, including sexual slavery, and the creation of a government support fund for victims. The government had one such center during the reporting period and allocated 5 million FCFA ($8,890) to it in 2017, a significant increase from 1.68 million FCFA ($2,990) allocated in 2016. The ministry did not report how many victims it referred to this center during the reporting period.The government did not have a formal policy to encourage victims to participate in trials against their traffickers but encouraged victims to do so by providing protection through the Ministry of Women, National Solidarity, and Family; a regional human rights office; or foreign victims' embassies. The government did not report if victims could legally file civil suits against their traffickers or otherwise obtain restitution. Foreign victims who face hardship or retribution in their country of origin could apply for asylum, but there were no reports trafficking victims applied for asylum during the reporting period. The government provided travel documents to facilitate repatriation of foreign trafficking victims identified in Burkina Faso and Burkinabes exploited in Lebanon. It transported Burkinabe trafficking victims repatriated from Libya, Nigeria, and Lebanon to the Ouagadougou shelter for care and, with an international donor, provided shelter, food, medical care, psychological support, and family reunification. There were no reports of trafficking victims penalized for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being subjected to trafficking; however, without uniform implementation of victim identification measures, including among vulnerable populations, some victims could have been left unidentified in the law enforcement system.","recommendation":"Increase efforts to investigate, prosecute, and convict traffickers\u0160including corrupt marabouts and traffickers posing as marabouts who exploit children in forced begging, and complicit officials\u0160and apply terms of imprisonment as prescribed in the 2008 anti-trafficking law; increase funding for police and security force units charged with investigating trafficking crimes; increase funding and in-kind support for victim services, including long-term services and social reintegration; train law enforcement to identify victims among vulnerable populations, including women in prostitution and children in agriculture and mining, and refer them to protective services; train law enforcement, prosecutors, and judicial officials on investigating and prosecuting trafficking cases, including cases that do not involve movement; investigate recruitment agencies suspected of fraudulently recruiting women for exploitation abroad; strengthen the system for collecting law enforcement and victim identification data; increase the availability of shelter and services for all victims, including adults; work with NGOs to raise awareness of trafficking, especially forced begging in Quranic schools and trafficking that does not involve movement; draft a national action plan to combat trafficking; and improve coordination among the anti-trafficking and child protection committees through funding, convening regularly, and sharing data.","tier":"TIER 2","traffick_profile":"As reported over the past five years, Burkina Faso is a source, transit, and destination country for women and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking. Traffickers promise families educational opportunities but instead force Burkinabe children to labor as farm hands, gold panners and washers in artisanal mines, street vendors, and domestic servants. In some cases, parents know their children will be exploited in domestic servitude but allow the exploitation to supplement the family income. Unscrupulous marabouts force children to beg in Quranic schools, sometimes with parents' knowledge. Girls are exploited in sex trafficking in Ouagadougou and in mining towns. Burkinabe children\u0160including orphan street children\u0160are transported to Cote d'Ivoire, Mali, and Niger for forced labor or sex trafficking. To a lesser extent, traffickers recruit women for ostensibly legitimate employment in Lebanon, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and\u0160to a lesser extent\u0160Europe and subsequently subject them to forced prostitution. Burkinabe women are also exploited in domestic servitude in the Middle East. During the reporting period, an international organization repatriated approximately 895 Burkinabe adults from Libya, some of whom were exploited in forced labor in construction and agriculture and forced prostitution in Libya. Burkina Faso is a transit country for traffickers transporting children from Mali to Cote d'Ivoire and women and girls from Cote d'Ivoire to Saudi Arabia, and it is a transit county for Ghanaian migrants traveling to Libya and Italy, some of whom are trafficking victims. Children from neighboring countries, including Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, Mali, Niger, and Nigeria, are subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking. Women from other West African countries are fraudulently recruited for employment in Burkina Faso and subsequently subjected to forced prostitution, forced labor in restaurants, or domestic servitude. Nigerian girls are exploited in sex trafficking in Burkina Faso. In past years, authorities have identified Nepalese traffickers subjecting Tibetan women to sex trafficking in Burkina Faso and Sri Lankan citizens transiting Burkina Faso allegedly en route to forced labor in a third country.

Despite the lack of significant efforts, the government took some steps to address trafficking, including revising the criminal code to integrate formally the penalties of the 2014 anti-trafficking law, organizing a workshop for law enforcement and civil society on the 2014 law, improving screening and scrutiny at the international airport, and investigating several cases involving the alleged recruitment of Burundian women for exploitation in the Middle East. However, the government did not investigate internal trafficking crimes and did not prosecute or convict any trafficking offenders for the third consecutive year. It did not investigate or hold accountable officials complicit in trafficking crimes, despite continuing allegations. Authorities continued to lack understanding of trafficking, and the government did not provide adequate anti-trafficking training for its personnel. The government did not provide victims with adequate protection services; in fact, victims continued to be subject to arrest and detention for crimes committed as a direct result of being subjected to trafficking.

The government had an inter-ministerial trafficking committee that met at least once during the reporting period, but it was not effective in leading or coordinating anti-trafficking efforts. The government did not establish the Commission for Consultation and Monitoring on the Prevention and Suppression of Trafficking in Persons, mandated by the 2014 anti-trafficking act, to provide inter-ministerial coordination and oversight. The government did not take steps to implement its national anti-trafficking action plan, which had been approved in March 2014. The government did not conduct anti-trafficking awareness campaigns in 2017. Burundi also remained without a government-run national hotline, but international organizations funded a national human rights hotline with operators trained to identify trafficking victims; the operators received 113 trafficking-related calls during the reporting period, but the international organization did not provide further details. Unlike the last reporting period when the government suspended the activities of five foreign recruitment agencies registered under the Agency for the Promotion of Investments, the government made no efforts to regulate labor recruitment agencies, nor were any held criminally accountable for fraudulent recruitment. The government did not make efforts to reduce the demand for forced labor, commercial sex, or child sex tourism. The government provided training on human rights and sexual exploitation, which reportedly included anti-trafficking elements, to its troops prior to their deployment abroad as part of international peacekeeping missions.","prosecution":"The government's law enforcement efforts remained insufficient. Burundi's 2014 anti-trafficking law criminalized forced labor and BURUNDI120sex trafficking. Prescribed penalties under the law ranged from five to 10 years imprisonment and were sufficiently stringent and, with respect to sex trafficking, commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. In 2017, the government revised the criminal code to integrate formally the penalties of the 2014 anti-trafficking law into the criminal code. Labor laws did not provide protection for domestic workers or employees in the informal economy, leaving that population vulnerable to trafficking. The government had no centralized data collection mechanism on trafficking, making comprehensive statistics difficult to obtain. While the government did not provide comprehensive statistics, according to media reports and statements by government spokespeople, at least 13 alleged traffickers were arrested for transnational trafficking in 2017; however, some of these arrests may have been for smuggling, as this is often conftated with human trafficking. This compared to the 25 arrests documented in 2016. Similar to the prior year, the government investigated transnational trafficking cases, but did not investigate internal trafficking or prosecute and convict any suspects during the reporting period. The government did not report any investigations, prosecutions, or convictions of government employees complicit in human trafficking offenses, despite ongoing reports of official complicity in trafficking crimes, including allegations of officials involved in the falsification of identity documents to facilitate trafficking. Moreover, security remained a concern for civil society organizations or individuals reporting on these allegations; several anti-trafficking activists fted the country during the previous reporting period after receiving threats against themselves and their families when they attempted to investigate a trafficking network or provide care to trafficking victims.The Ministry of Human Rights organized an awareness workshop on the 2014 anti-trafficking law, which included civil society, ministry officials, and the Burundian National Police Unit (BNP) for the Protection of Minors and Morals. However, in general, the government did not provide adequate funding or training for law enforcement agencies responsible for investigating trafficking crimes, and corruption continued to plague law enforcement, severely limiting its capacity and effectiveness. Without training on standard procedures, local police reportedly arrested suspected traffickers but often did not refer the cases to the BNP's Unit for the Protection of Minors and Morals, the lead investigating body for trafficking cases, which led to poor case investigations; officials' lack of investigative skills and insufficient understanding of trafficking crimes continued to impede investigations. ","protection":"The government maintained minimal protection efforts. The government did not maintain statistics on human trafficking, making it difficult to determine the number of victims, if any, whom the government referred to or provided with protective services. Civil society continued to provide the vast majority of assistance to trafficking victims. In 2017, the media reported that the BNP identified 46 potential female trafficking victims en route to Tanzania, Oman, and other Gulf countries, or planning to transit through Uganda, which was a decrease compared to 75 potential victims identified by police in 2016. One NGO reported identifying 338 victims who had returned from trafficking situations in various Middle Eastern countries, while another reported 356 women remained in potential trafficking situations in the Middle East. One NGO also reported identifying 134 potential victims en route to the Middle East; reportedly some were referred to services or returned to their families, but the NGO did not report how many received assistance. However, due to a lack of adequate training on victim identification and probable conftation with smuggling in some cases, some of the victims reportedly identified by law enforcement and NGOs may not have been trafficking victims. An NGO reported funding the repatriation of 31 young women from the Middle East, but noted that over 800 young women remained in Oman and Saudi Arabia awaiting repatriation. Another NGO reported funding and assisting in the repatriation of at least two Burundian trafficking victims and providing them with reintegration assistance; both were victims of fraudulent recruitment in Burundi and forced labor in Kuwait. An NGO reported that Burundian diplomats assisted in removing victims from exploitative conditions and in accessing medical assistance. However, the government did not report on efforts by its officials, including staff within its missions in destination countries, to facilitate or fund the repatriation of Burundian victims identified abroad, collaborate with host governments, or subsequently assist victims among this population. An international organization reported separating five Burundian children from opposition armed groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) during the reporting period, but did not report further details.The government did not report the number of victims who received assistance. Overall, a lack of dedicated funding for victim protection measures seriously constrained the government's ability to assist victims. The government continued to operate Humura Center in Gitega, which provided protection to foreign and domestic victims of sexual, gender-based violence and trafficking, but did not report the number of trafficking victims it assisted during the reporting period. The Humura Center provided temporary shelter, medical care, and guidance on engaging with law enforcement and the judicial system and was accessible to victims with disabilities. The Seruka Center was an NGO-run center in Bujumbura that did not receive government funding; it provided medical and psycho-social assistance, as well as legal assistance to victims of various abuses, including human trafficking. Adult and child victims received assistance in the same facilities, and adults and children, men and women, and foreign and domestic victims all received the same care. The Seruka Center reported providing care to three trafficking victims in 2017. The government did not have formal procedures for authorities to identify and refer trafficking victims to protection services, and law enforcement officials lacked adequate training to identify potential victims. However, immigration officials at the Bujumbura International Airport, some of whom received training on preventing trafficking provided by an international organization and a local NGO, did have some success in screening for trafficking; this resulted in the identification of some potential trafficking victims and deterrence of traffickers from transiting victims through Bujumbura. Screening included extensive questioning regarding the purpose and final destination of travel, including address and phone number, and review of documentation; however, the government did not provide information on the number of victims identified by immigration officials. The government routinely arrested victims for questioning and would sometimes inappropriately penalize trafficking victims for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being subjected to trafficking by detaining them in jail for several days. Despite the requirements of the 2016 law for the protection of witnesses, victims, and vulnerable persons, the government did not make any progress on the establishment of a unit within the Ministry of Justice BURUNDI121to coordinate protection measures. Burundian law did not allow trafficking victims to obtain restitution; however, it did provide foreign trafficking victims with legal alternatives to their removal to countries where they may face hardship or retribution, subject to judicial decision.","recommendation":"Implement the anti-trafficking law and significantly increase efforts to more effectively investigate, prosecutes, and convict traffickers, including allegedly complicit officials; institutionalize anti-trafficking training to include how to implement the anti-trafficking law for all law enforcement, prosecutors, and judges; establish standardized procedures for officials to proactively identify trafficking victims, including children and adults, and refer them to appropriate care; implement the national action plan; develop national level data collection on law enforcement efforts and trafficking victims; ensure trafficking victims, including children and adults who are forcefully or fraudulently recruited into opposition armed groups, are not punished or detained for crimes committed as a direct result of being subjected to trafficking; drastically improve provision of protective services to trafficking victims, including through partnerships with NGOs that provide appropriate care to victims, and by providing separate shelter for children and adults; take measures to ensure children and adults are not forcibly or fraudulently recruited into governmental and non-governmental armed forces, and provide them with appropriate protection services; and enact effective policies to regulate labor recruitment agencies and hold fraudulent recruiters criminally accountable and undertake efforts to reduce child sex tourism.","tier":"TIER 3","traffick_profile":"As reported over the past five years, Burundi is a source country for men, women and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking. As the result of a complex political, economic, and security crisis that began in 2015, more than 420,000 Burundians sought refuge in neighboring countries and many others sought refuge at internally displaced persons camps or moved to the homes of extended family members. Burundi's challenging security environment and endemic poverty created an opportunity for criminals, including traffickers, to take advantage of Burundians in precarious or desperate situations. Between April and December 2015, approximately 70,000 Burundian refugees fted to Rwanda, which contributed to an increase in child sex trafficking of both male and female refugees in Rwanda. In July 2015, approximately 58 children, some younger than 15 years old, were fraudulently recruited and forced to participate in an anti-government armed invasion in Kayanza Province, which was ultimately put down by the government; it was unclear if these children were armed. Between May and December 2015, an international organization reported allegations that Burundian refugees residing in Mahama refugee camp in Rwanda were recruited into non-state armed groups, allegedly by Rwandan security forces, to support the Burundian opposition; many refugees alleged recruiters had threatened, intimidated, harassed, and physically assaulted those who refused recruitment\u0160a form of human trafficking. Most of these recruits were adult males, but six Burundian refugee children, between the ages of 15 and 17, were also identified as recruits from Mahama refugee camp. The same international organization also reported that hundreds of Burundian adult and child recruits, including girls, were allegedly trained in weaponry at a training camp in southwestern Rwanda. Some of these adult and child refugees could be victims of human trafficking. In December 2014, an armed group of primarily Burundian rebels invaded the northwestern province of Cibitoke; the estimated 150 rebels reportedly included child soldiers as young as 15-years-old, some of whom were trained in Rwanda. In 2016, the Government of the DRC apprehended 16 Burundian children transiting through the east allegedly after recruitment from refugee camps in Rwanda or the DRC to participate in armed conftict in Burundi with an unknown entity. The government encouraged citizens to participate in community work each Saturday morning and the governors of various provinces sporadically fined residents who failed to participate. Both coercion and economic necessity pushed children and young adults into labor, including forced labor on plantations or small farms throughout Burundi, in gold mines in Cibitoke, in informal commerce in the streets of larger cities, collecting river stones for construction in Bujumbura, and in the fishing industry. Traffickers include victims' relatives, neighbors, and friends, who recruit them under false pretenses to exploit them in forced labor and sex trafficking. Some families are complicit in the exploitation of children and adults with disabilities, accepting payment from traffickers who run forced street begging operations. Children are subjected to domestic servitude in private homes, experiencing non-payment of wages and verbal and physical abuse. Children in domestic servitude or working in guesthouses and entertainment establishments may also be exploited in prostitution. Children are fraudulently recruited from rural areas for domestic work and later exploited in prostitution, including in Bujumbura. International organizations reported that young Muslim women from Burundi were particularly vulnerable to forced labor and sex trafficking in various Gulf countries. Young adult Burundian women are fraudulently recruited for fake jobs and are instead subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking in various Gulf countries, such as Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Oman; NGOs estimate that between 500 and 3,000 young women have become trafficking victims in these countries between 2015 and 2016 and one NGO reported over 800 young women remain in these countries. In 2017, several adult Burundian women were identified in Kuwait, where they had been fraudulently recruited by Burundian recruitment agencies and Kenyan recruiters for work as domestic workers and receptionists; however, upon arrival they were subjected to forced labor and had their passports confiscated, were paid less than what was agreed, had restricted movement, and were made to work excessive hours without breaks. Young women take vulnerable girls into their homes, eventually pushing some into prostitution to pay for living expenses. These brothels are located in poorer areas of Bujumbura, along the lake, on trucking routes, and in other urban centers such as Ngozi, Gitega, and Rumonge. Some orphaned girls are exploited in prostitution, with boys acting as their facilitators, to pay for school, food, and shelter. NGOs reported that some boys in the Lake Tanganyika fisheries are subjected to forced labor and that some girls and young women are exploited in domestic servitude and sex trafficking by fishermen. Incarcerated women facilitate commercial sex between male prisoners and detained children within the Burundian prison system. Male tourists from East Africa and the Middle East, as well as Burundian government employees, including teachers, police officers and gendarmes, military, and prison officials, are among the clients of Burundian girls in child sex trafficking. Businesspeople recruit BURUNDI122Burundian girls for exploitation in prostitution in Bujumbura, as well as in Rwanda, Kenya, Uganda, and the Middle East; they also recruit boys and girls for various types of forced labor in southern Burundi and Tanzania. In 2015, Rwandan officials and international and local NGOs reported that Burundian refugee girls were exploited in prostitution in Uganda after transiting Rwanda; some of these girls may also have been subjected to forced labor in domestic work in Uganda."},"Cambodia":{"April":0.0,"Asylum Seekers":"2","August":0.0,"December":0.0,"February":0.0,"Friday":2.0,"Global Population":16249.79,"January":0.0,"July":1.0,"June":0.0,"Life Expectancy":69.57,"March":0.0,"May":1.0,"Monday":0.0,"November":1.0,"October":0.0,"Population below $1.90 a day":"NA","Saturday":1.0,"September":0.0,"Sunday":0.0,"Thursday":0.0,"Tuesday":0.0,"Violence against civilians":3,"Wednesday":0.0,"fatalities":["1","0","0"],"government_effort":"NA","introduction":"The Government of Cambodia does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. The government demonstrated increasing efforts compared to the previous reporting period; therefore Cambodia remained on Tier 2. The government demonstrated increasing efforts by prosecuting and convicting more traffickers, repatriating more Cambodians subjected to trafficking abroad, strengthening efforts to raise awareness on child sexual exploitation in the hospitality industry, and taking steps to incentivize safe migration to primary destination countries. However, the government did not meet the minimum standards in several key areas. Endemic corruption continued to impede law enforcement operations, criminal proceedings, and victim service provision. Authorities did not issue formal guidance allowing the use of undercover investigative techniques in anti-trafficking operations\u0160a factor that continued to impede officials' ability to fully hold sex traffickers accountable. Against a backdrop of insufficient government oversight and accountability measures, unscrupulous business owners subjected thousands of men, women, and children throughout the country to debt bondage in hard labor with minimal interference\u0160and sometimes assistance\u0160from Cambodian authorities.","iso3":"KHM","latitude":["12.5387","11.4232","11.7502"],"location":["Pursat","Romeas Haek","Thma Bang"],"longitude":["103.9192","105.7723","103.49600000000001"],"notes":"At the end of Nov 2018, in Pursat Province, a small mob attacked a couple, accusing them of killing someone's daughter with sorcery.

On May 12, a environmentalist was shot at by unidentified gunmen in Chrak Russey village in Thmar Baing district, Koh Kong.","prevention":"The government increased some prevention efforts. In November, Cambodia signed the ASEAN Consensus on the Protection and Promotion of the Rights of Migrant Workers, which aimed to further prohibit confiscation of migrant workers' travel documents, cease imposition of excessive recruitment fees, and increase regulation of recruiters. An interagency committee and its secretariat coordinated anti-trafficking activities and continued to implement the 2014-2018 national action plan; however, authorities did not report steps to prepare for activities subsequent to its conclusion in 2018. The government allocated 4.9 billion riels ($1.2 million) to fund this interagency committee\u0160an increase from 4 billion riels ($975,000) in 2016\u0160but observers noted this figure was still insufficient. Subsidiary provincial anti-trafficking committees, which reportedly continued to receive modest central government funds and assistance from NGOs, coordinated efforts at the local level to mirror the activities of the national action plan. With the help of international donors, six out of nine of these committees created their own provincial-level action plans and submitted them to the government (five in 2016). The secretariat of the NCCT maintained a working group to monitor the efforts of the interagency committee as well as those of its provincial subsidiary committees. However, NGOs noted the provincial committees' ad hoc reliance on insufficient surplus funds from General Social Services\u0160rather than on their own annual budgets\u0160undermined the scope and sustainability of their work. Lack of coordinating guidance from the national counterpart committee further impeded their effectiveness.The Ministry of Labor and Vocational Training (MLVT) maintained a separate action plan aimed at reducing child labor and debt bondage in the service, agricultural, mining, and energy sectors by 2025 through awareness raising, increased legal action, and collaboration with civil society, funded in part through the national budget. MLVT also continued to implement its \ufb01National Employment Policy 2025,\ufb02 which sought to generate secure employment opportunities in hopes of discouraging the use of illicit migration channels known for trafficking vulnerabilities. The government continued to investigate and prosecute labor recruiters for illegal practices that may have contributed to or involved trafficking; in August, authorities shut down an unlicensed recruitment firm and arrested three men suspected of facilitating illicit labor migration to Japan. The government did not report whether the arrests culminated in further investigations, prosecutions, or convictions; officials and NGO observers noted labor officials' failure to sufficiently inspect private recruitment agencies, and the ability of these agencies to sub-license their names to independent brokers, continued to perpetuate widespread labor exploitation.The Ministry of Education trained 894 of its officials and teachers across six provinces on trafficking awareness and safe migration during the reporting period. The General Department of Immigration also issued 210,000 border passes to Cambodian migrant workers, in lieu of passports, to incentivize safe labor migration to Thailand; as part of the same initiative, the government sent 360 officials to Thailand on a 100-day campaign to issue necessary documentation to migrant workers. The MFAIC continued to implement consular screening measures to reduce the sex and labor trafficking of Cambodian women via forced and fraudulent marriages, including by assessing applicants against trafficking victim profiles jointly developed with China in 2016. However, the MFA did not report referring these potential victims to law enforcement or protective services. The government maintained two labor recruitment agreements with Saudi Arabia and signed a new domestic worker recruitment agreement with Hong Kong.The Ministry of Tourism held workshops for hotel staff and government officials on preventing child sexual exploitation in the hospitality industry. As in prior years, the government generally focused on deterring foreign involvement in child sex tourism, rather than targeting campaigns to the local population that constituted the main source of demand for commercial sex with children in Cambodia. Authorities reported arresting five foreign individuals suspected of engaging in child sex tourism (12 in 2016) but did not report whether they initiated prosecutions in any of these cases. Local experts reported concern over the government's ongoing failure to impose appropriate punishments on foreign nationals who purchase commercial sex acts with children. The government provided anti-trafficking training for its diplomatic personnel and to members of the military prior to their deployment abroad on peacekeeping initiatives.","prosecution":"The government increased some law enforcement efforts. The 2008 Law on the Suppression of Human Trafficking and Commercial Sexual Exploitation criminalized sex and labor trafficking and prescribed penalties of seven to 15 years imprisonment; these penalties were sufficiently stringent and, with respect to sex trafficking, commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. The Anti-Human Trafficking Juvenile Police (AHTJP) attempted to monitor and record information on the cases it investigated, but the government did not collect comprehensive data on overall law enforcement efforts, particularly among provincial courts. However, the information authorities provided, augmented by media and NGO reports, indicated authorities prosecuted 207 individuals under the anti-trafficking law or related provisions in the penal code in 2017 (53 in 2016). The National Committee for Counter Trafficking (NCCT) reported courts convicted at least 129 traffickers, up from 100 in 2016. The government did not provide data on sentencing, but courts reportedly continued to conclude sex trafficking cases with monetary settlements in lieu of prison sentences, and victims whose families received out-of-court settlements from traffickers often changed their testimony, further complicating prosecutions.Law enforcement authorities often did not take appropriate action against suspected or convicted traffickers, including orphanage directors complicit in child trafficking crimes. Judicial police lacked the resources to monitor the increasing number of defendants released on \ufb01judicial supervision\ufb02 pending trial, allowing many to ftee prior to their trial dates. Authorities did not always issue arrest warrants for absconded defendants. Citing resource constraints, prosecutors and investigating judges did not advance all of the trafficking cases for which police had supplied evidence. Authorities also abused law enforcement resources to detain, prosecute, and convict some foreign individuals on politically motivated trafficking charges, further bringing into question the veracity of the anti-trafficking data\u0160and the resource constraints\u0160reported by the government. Local experts continued to report cases involving foreign suspects were more likely to result in trafficking convictions than cases involving Cambodian suspects, for whom charges were often reduced to less serious offenses. The government continued to deliver donor-designed and funded training on the implementation of anti-trafficking laws to police, prosecutors, judges, and other government officials. During the reporting period, the NCCT delivered 66 trainings to 1,577 law enforcement officers on anti-trafficking laws, investigative techniques, and evidence collection; it did not report how many commune and provincial officials, judicial staff, and NGO workers participated in these sessions (7,689 in 2016). Local organizations and some officials continued to stress an urgent need for more sophisticated evidence collection techniques, including undercover investigation, to decrease reliance on witness testimony and adapt to the increasingly clandestine nature of sex trafficking. However, the government did not grant undercover investigative authority to anti-trafficking police units, except in rare cases when requested for child sex tourism raids conducted alongside foreign law enforcement agencies. This continued to significantly constrain CAMBODIA125126CAMBODIAlaw enforcement officers' ability to address the increasingly clandestine nature of sex trafficking operations in Cambodia.Endemic corruption at all levels of government severely limited the ability of individual officials to make progress in holding traffickers accountable. The Cambodian national police maintained a mechanism for NGO workers to report incidents of corruption among anti-trafficking police, but it did not field any complaints during the reporting period. Local officials facilitated cross-border trafficking by accepting bribes for forging identity documents. One NGO noted law enforcement raids on sex trafficking establishments were sometimes unsuccessful due to advance warning from working-level police. However, some provincial police chiefs reportedly worked to minimize these leaks by turning over cases to the AHTJP, which conducted independent raids without notifying the local authorities until moments before they began. Some corrupt officials may have profited directly from establishments suspected of sex and labor trafficking. NGO observers claimed Cambodian police officers also solicited commercial sex with minors during the reporting period. One NGO alleged prosecutors and judges accepted bribes in return for dismissal of charges and acquittals. Corrupt officials often thwarted progress in cases where the perpetrators were believed to have political, criminal, or economic ties to government officials. Despite these trends, the government did not investigate, prosecute, or convict any government employees complicit in trafficking, nor did it take any punitive measures against Phnom Penh's former anti-trafficking police chief, who was ultimately promoted to a higher government position after his 2011 trafficking conviction was overturned in an unannounced, closed-door Supreme Court hearing in 2013. ","protection":"The government decreased protection efforts. Despite maintaining victim identification guidelines developed by the Ministry of Social Affairs, Veterans, and Youth Rehabilitation (MOSAVY) in early 2017, disparate victim identification, referral, and repatriation efforts remained underdeveloped and overlapping across government and law enforcement agencies. Authorities did not provide complete statistics on the number of victims they assisted or referred. During the reporting period, the government imposed a new regulation barring NGOs from representing individuals seeking formal recognition as trafficking victims. Under this new arrangement\u0160which NGOs claimed severely intimidated victims and their families\u0160victims were required to approach the Ministry of Interior for the formal identification needed to access protection services. With assistance from an international organization, the government continued to operate two transit centers in the border city of Poipet, where it screened for trafficking victims among the approximately 70,500 migrants deported from Thailand in 2017 (55,000 in 2016). However, it did not report identifying any victims through this center; given the extent of trafficking among this population and the lack of universal implementation of victim identification standards, many victims likely transited the center unidentified. The government operated a temporary shelter in Phnom Penh for female victims of trafficking and other crimes, and it referred trafficking victims to donor-funded NGO shelters\u0160most of which cared for victims of several forms of abuse\u0160to receive further assistance. The government continued to rely heavily on NGOs to protect trafficking victims; however, it did not facilitate formal transfer of custody for child victims, leaving organizations that accepted child victims vulnerable to court action. Provisions allowing for financial settlements in lieu of harsher sentencing further discouraged some families from consenting to temporary guardianship at shelters; absent family consent, government officials at times returned children to high-risk environments, leaving them vulnerable to re-victimization. Despite the prominence of male labor trafficking victims, assistance for this population remained limited.Cambodian diplomatic missions overseas continued to lack adequate funding and capacity to provide basic assistance or repatriate victims, despite government action in prior years to train diplomats on migrant worker protections. Victims identified in countries without Cambodian diplomatic representation had access to even less support. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation (MFAIC), which bore the primary responsibility of aiding Cambodian trafficking victims, reported repatriating 986 Cambodian trafficking victims from nine countries (815 from 11 countries in 2016); this included 382 victims from Malaysia, 288 from Thailand, 171 from Vietnam, 53 from China, 49 from Laos, 23 from Indonesia, 12 from Japan, five from Singapore, and three from Burma. An international organization assisted in the majority of these repatriations. The government reportedly maintained a victim reintegration center specifically for Cambodian and foreign survivors of a widely publicized maritime forced labor case in Indonesian waters in 2015; through this center, authorities held an annual regional victims' workshop and provided psycho-social services, but it was unclear if this work relied on assistance from international donors. The MFA did not promulgate or implement standard operating procedures for the identification and referral of Cambodian victims abroad, leaving many Cambodians without the assistance necessary to repatriate legally and safely. According to local service provision NGOs, some returned victims had been unable to secure assistance from Cambodian consular services in Thailand and Korea due to unattended hotlines and unresponsive staff; others confined in forced labor conditions abroad, including in Malaysia, were unable to convince Cambodian consular staff they were in need of assistance. MOSAVY reported assisting in the repatriation of 243 Cambodians in 2017, including 114 from Malaysia, 45 from Thailand, 21 from Indonesia, 21 from China, 18 from Somalia, 16 from Vietnam, six from Japan, and one each from Saudi Arabia and Singapore (195 total in 2016). Local police referred 179 sex and labor trafficking victims to provincial social service providers and NGOs for further protections (326 in 2016); MOSAVY did not report assisting in this process (62 referred by MOSAVY in 2016). One NGO recorded receiving and assisting 395 Cambodian trafficking victims from nine countries; it was unclear if this figure was captured in the statistics provided by the MFAIC, or to what extent the MFAIC data included cases received by MOSAVY. The number of Cambodian returnees who were subjected to trafficking abroad was likely much higher than reported due to an increasing tendency among these groups to return via informal migration channels. The government required the repatriation of foreign victims, except in rare cases, and did not provide legal alternatives to their removal regardless of whether they may face hardship or retribution upon return to their countries of origin. MOSAVY repatriated three trafficking victims to Vietnam after they received care in NGO-run shelters (13 in 2016). Insufficient victim identification efforts left many potential victims at risk of law enforcement action, including punitive deportation without prior screening. Law enforcement often did not keep victims and perpetrators separated during interviews. NGOs noted police made some progress in implementing child-127CAMBODIAfriendly practices during the reporting period, and government social workers reported positive cooperation with the AHTJP, including in timely victim intake and referral procedures. However, provincial courts did not universally implement a child-friendly judicial program initiated in 2016 barring direct cross-examination of victims in front of the accused and relying instead on video-conferencing technology. Cambodia's weak and corrupt legal system and the lack of adequate victim and witness protection, exacerbated by a lengthy trial process and fear of retaliation by traffickers, hindered victims' willingness to cooperate in many cases. Victims were theoretically eligible for restitution, although it was extremely difficult to obtain due to a legal requirement delaying payment until after the completion of the trafficker's jail term; convicted traffickers' frequent abscondment further complicated this arrangement. NGOs noted victims rarely received the amount promised, and many victims' families settled out of court with traffickers or accepted bribes to drop the relevant charges.","recommendation":"Vigorously investigate and prosecute trafficking offenses and convict and stringently penalize sex and labor traffickers, including complicit officials, with prison sentences; authorize the use of undercover investigative techniques for anti-trafficking operations; strengthen efforts to fully implement the nationwide protocol for proactive victim identification among vulnerable groups and train officials on its provisions; increase labor inspections in high-vulnerability professions, especially at brick kilns, fisheries, and plantations, with a focus on identifying debt bondage; increase the availability of services for male victims, especially men and boys exploited in commercial fishing; increase inspection and oversight of lending institutions, including private micro-finance organizations, to reduce vulnerability to debt bondage among economically disadvantaged communities; modify the law to allow restitution upon conviction of the trafficker; establish and allocate resources to implement systematic procedures at diplomatic missions to assist Cambodian victims abroad, including in countries without Cambodian diplomatic representation; strengthen efforts to inspect private labor recruitment agencies and their sub-licensed brokers for fraudulent recruitment and other trafficking indicators; increase public awareness on proper travel document application procedures to facilitate safe, legal migration; implement a system for monitoring, collecting, and reporting data on anti-trafficking prosecution and victim protection efforts, and disseminate data among the relevant government agencies in a manner that protects victims' identities and privacy; increase budgetary allocations to national and provincial-level anti-trafficking committees; strengthen efforts to incorporate NGO input into the policy for formally transferring custody of child victims; allocate increased resources to anti-human trafficking police to better facilitate the monitoring of defendants released under judicial supervision pending trial; and enhance public awareness campaigns aimed at reducing domestic demand for commercial sex and child sex tourism. ","tier":"TIER 2","traffick_profile":"As reported over the last five years, Cambodia is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking. Cambodian adults and children migrate to other countries within the region and increasingly to the Middle East for work; many are subjected to forced labor on fishing vessels, in agriculture, in construction, in factories, and in domestic servitude\u0160often through debt bondage\u0160or to sex trafficking. Migrants using irregular migration channels, predominantly with the assistance of unlicensed brokers, are at an increased risk of trafficking, but those using licensed recruiting agents also become victims of forced labor or sex trafficking. Children from impoverished families are vulnerable to forced labor, often with the complicity of their families, including in domestic servitude and forced begging or street vending in Thailand and Vietnam. Significant numbers of Cambodian men and boys continue to be recruited in Thailand to work on fishing boats and are subjected to forced labor on Thai-owned and operated vessels in international waters. Cambodian victims escaping from this form of exploitation have been identified in Malaysia, Indonesia, Mauritius, Fiji, Senegal, South Africa, and Papua New Guinea. Cambodian men report severe abuses by Thai captains, deceptive recruitment, underpaid wages, and being forced to remain aboard vessels for years. A significant number of women from rural areas are recruited under false pretenses to travel to China to enter into marriages with Chinese 128CAMEROONmen, who often incur as much as $20,000 in debt to brokers facilitating the transaction; some of these women are then subjected to forced factory labor or forced prostitution as a result of this debt.All of Cambodia's 25 provinces are sources for human trafficking. Sex trafficking is largely clandestine; Cambodian and ethnic Vietnamese women and girls move from rural areas to cities and tourist destinations, where they are subjected to sex trafficking in brothels and, more frequently, such \ufb01indirect\ufb02 sex establishments as beer gardens, massage parlors, salons, karaoke bars, retail spaces, and non-commercial sites. Cambodian men form the largest source of demand for children exploited in prostitution; however, men from elsewhere in Asia and Europe, the United States, Australia, and South Africa travel to Cambodia to engage in child sex tourism. The proprietors of brick kilns often subject Cambodian men, women, and children\u0160often entire families\u0160to debt bondage, either by buying off their preexisting loans or by requiring them to take out new loans as a condition of employment. An extensive, largely unregulated network of predatory microfinance organizations and private creditors contributes to this arrangement by proactively advertising loans to families in vulnerable communities and connecting them with the kilns. An NGO study conducted in 2017 found nearly 100 percent of brick kilns surveyed throughout the country featured indicators of debt bondage. Children as young as 13 are also subjected to forced domestic servitude and labor on riparian and oceanic fishing boats, in karaoke bars, and on cassava plantations to pay off family debts accrued through this system. Vietnamese women and children, many of whom are victims of debt bondage, travel to Cambodia and are subjected to sex trafficking. NGOs report criminal gangs transport some Vietnamese victims through Cambodia before they are exploited in Thailand and Malaysia. Traffickers in Cambodia are most commonly family or community members or small networks of independent brokers. Some Cambodian orphanages purchase local children from economically disadvantaged families and subject them to malnutrition and unclean living conditions in their facilities for the purpose of attracting and profiting from charitable donations; some of these children are at further risk of sex trafficking and domestic servitude as a result of poor government oversight of the adoption processes. Endemic corruption aids and abets trafficking crimes. Some police reportedly solicit commercial sex with children. Corrupt officials facilitate cross-border trafficking, thwart progress on investigations and prosecutions, and in some cases profit directly from establishments suspected of trafficking."},"Cameroon":{"April":19.0,"Asylum Seekers":"25","August":26.0,"December":33.0,"February":29.0,"Friday":39.0,"Global Population":25216.27,"January":18.0,"July":28.0,"June":22.0,"Life Expectancy":58.92,"March":16.0,"May":21.0,"Monday":53.0,"November":17.0,"October":44.0,"Population below $1.90 a day":"23.8","Saturday":57.0,"September":34.0,"Sunday":33.0,"Thursday":48.0,"Tuesday":35.0,"Violence against civilians":307,"Wednesday":42.0,"fatalities":["0","0","1","1","0","1","1","0","1","3","1","0","2","1","0","0","0","0","0","1","1","0","2","0","2","1","7","0","1","0","1","0","0","0","1","1","0","3","0","0","0","1","0","1","1","0","2","1","4","1","5","1","0","2","0","1","0","0","2","1","2","2","1","4","1","2","0","4","3","0","0","0","1","1","4","1","2","15","2","0","0","0","0","1","2","0","3","0","1","1","1","1","2","1","0","3","2","1","4","7","4","2","6","2","2","2","7","1","2","4","0","1","2","0","1","0","0","2","0","1","4","2","0","0","2","1","5","1","1","0","1","0","1","0","0","0","1","2","1","0","1","1","0","0","1","1","2","0","0","1","0","0","1","1","9","1","5","1","1","1","5","1","5","1","0","0","1","1","1","1","1","0","2","4","15","3","5","1","4","2","1","1","1","2","0","3","3","1","2","2","1","1","0","0","0","0","2","2","1","1","0","1","1","0","1","1","1","0","1","0","10","0","8","0","37","0","0","0","10","1","0","1","1","14","0","0","1","10","1","1","1","1","0","0","0","0","2","0","0","0","2","0","7","1","0","1","2","1","1","1","1","1","0","0","0","0","1","1","1","1","0","1","0","5","0","3","3","1","1","1","5","0","0","0","1","1","0","1","6","0","4","1","0","2","0","2","1","5","0","1","0","0","1","1","0","7","1","4","0","0","2","3","1","1","2","1","0"],"government_effort":"NA","introduction":"The Government of Cameroon does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. The government demonstrated increasing efforts compared to the previous reporting period; therefore Cameroon was upgraded to Tier 2. The government demonstrated increasing efforts by raising the number of investigations, prosecutions, and convictions of suspected traffickers; training law enforcement, judicial officials, and civil society actors on trafficking provisions in the revised penal code; increasing direct services to potential trafficking victims from Cameroon and other African countries; enhancing screening procedures at primary airports; and re-invigorating the inter-ministerial committee. However, the government did not meet the minimum standards in several key areas. The government did not fully disseminate its victim identification and national referral system (NRS) and standard operating procedures (SOPs) to all law enforcement or first responders, nor did it pass draft anti-trafficking legislation from 2012 that conforms to international law.","iso3":"CMR","latitude":["3.8667","5.5054","11.0868","5.8636","7.0736","11.1621","6.4263","7.0736","5.8636","6.4649","12.3666","3.8667","11.0868","6.2","5.9951","4.1527","5.9333","4.1527","4.7466","6.1333","4.1527","5.9333","6.2","4.1527","11.6828","6.2","3.8667","5.8358","6.2","4.1527","6.2","6.2","6.2","5.9333","6.1333","5.6296","4.6921","5.2013","11.204","11.1367","4.1527","6.4263","4.1527","10.5909","12.7842","5.9333","5.8358","10.992","11.1343","6.5333","5.5454","5.9","6.1","5.76","4.075","5.8196","4.8277","12.5692","5.9455","6.3833","11.2426","11.1343","5.9895","6.5667","6.2","6.2","10.9754","6.4167","5.9333","6.1","5.9333","4.5051","4.2898","5.8873","4.0913","5.9333","4.6921","5.0288","10.7424","6.0167","6.7026","11.1621","4.1527","5.0288","11.1742","4.3557","4.1214","4.1527","5.9785","4.1527","4.1527","4.2106","4.1527","4.1527","4.1527","12.624","5.8873","3.8667","5.6991","4.1527","11.0768","12.405999999999999","10.5344","5.9884","4.1527","4.6921","6.252999999999999","5.8873","6.1166","12.652000000000001","4.6921","6.4263","5.9910000000000005","4.0816","5.8873","4.1527","4.0794","5.0288","3.8667","5.9333","5.0288","11.1106","6.0833","6.0833","12.3731","5.9455","5.7827","6.3833","12.3731","4.1527","11.0936","6.5333","5.8388","4.075","6.3833","6.3833","12.1486","11.0485","11.1621","5.9884","4.5407","4.603","10.6316","12.7944","11.2331","4.5343","6.0167","5.9333","11.7131","4.0913","5.9333","4.6187","11.1468","5.6261","4.1527","10.9991","10.3659","10.992","11.0336","11.0281","11.1106","12.7676","11.05","10.992","11.2191","12.6356","12.5628","11.0336","10.9638","6.2","4.2898","11.0336","11.020999999999999","10.5909","5.8358","4.6921","5.9895","11.1621","4.6921","12.624","4.6921","6.0167","11.1198","11.1198","5.0288","12.2198","11.0051","12.5514","4.6921","5.9333","6.25","4.6921","5.0856","4.4023","4.501","4.5407","5.8358","12.7842","4.603","5.7131","4.3557","11.1842","6.25","7.7708","5.8156","11.1621","11.1291","12.2198","11.6378","4.1527","5.8358","4.2898","5.7408","5.0856","4.4721","5.9333","5.8719","4.4589","4.5051","10.9912","4.4492","10.9912","11.0485","9.3218","12.5628","6.1333","11.2426","4.405","11.1689","11.1621","4.2898","4.6921","5.7131","4.501","11.6828","6.1333","11.7131","4.9479","11.2426","12.6349","11.1742","5.6352","5.3299","11.2331","5.8719","5.8719","12.0152","10.9638","4.5497","5.7131","10.7424","5.1572","4.6187","5.4685","5.7131","12.6943","4.1527","4.4721","4.6921","5.754","4.6507","4.4279","4.5343","11.1842","5.8358","11.0336","11.25","10.9754","4.1527","4.7205","11.128","5.9333","4.7317","4.5497","4.1527","4.9479","5.8358","6.25","10.7424","4.5497","5.9333","5.9333","5.9333","11.1291","4.5497","5.9333","6.1333","11.0485","5.9333","5.7987","6.1333","5.0856","6.2372","11.3311","12.3731","4.5497","11.4043","10.199","4.5497","11.4043","11.1333","11.0651","11.128","9.3218","4.5832","11.0336","11.1621"],"location":["Yaounde","Foumbot","Tarmoua","Bangourain","Belel","Kolofata","Ndu","Belel","Bangourain","Tibati","Bodo","Yaounde","Tarmoua","Kumbo","Nkwen","Buea","Bamenda","Buea","Tombel","Belo","Buea","Bamenda","Kumbo","Buea","Zigague","Kumbo","Yaounde","Batibo","Kumbo","Buea","Kumbo","Kumbo","Kumbo","Bamenda","Belo","Kembong","Kumba","Ngwa","Gogolomiyode","Gogo","Buea","Ndu","Buea","Maroua","Tchika","Bamenda","Batibo","Baljoel","Igawa","Zoa","Tinto","Balikumbat","Jakiri","Mbeme","Tiko","Njenka","Nyassosso","Kassibe","Bamali","Wum","Amchide","Igawa","Bambili","Essu","Kumbo","Kumbo","Vourkaza","Rom","Bamenda","Jakiri","Bamenda","Baba","Muyuka","Bali","Mutengene","Bamenda","Kumba","Ekona","Mokolo","Sabga","Dumbo","Kolofata","Buea","Ekona","Double-Alagarno","Bafia","Tole","Buea","Bamessing","Buea","Buea","Mamu","Buea","Buea","Buea","Ngouma","Bali","Yaounde","Bachuo

In the Belo region a 26-year-old man was killed, shot dead while hiding in a loft space while security forces were trashing private homes. Witnesses spoke of destroyed homes, broken windows and televisions, radios and computers thrown into a pile then set ablaze. 5 civilians were killed and 6 others wounded by a 42nd BIM soldier between 2am and 5am in Mora. On 1 February, men dressed in civilian clothes but believed to be security forces shot a man at his shop in Bamenda and took him away. A civilian died after being shot by soldiers during an operation in the nearby city of Santa. On 30 January, an Ambazonia separatist attacked the Ntungfe primary school in Belo, and shot and wounded a teacher. The sub-prefect and his staff were kidnapped. They were subsequently freed by the security forces. On 29 January, a student was killed by security forces in Shishong, Kumbo. A man was killed while at his field by Boko Haram. A man was kidnapped in Minimari, Fotokol. On 18 January, security forces raided Kwakwa village, Bole, burning hundreds of houses and killing at least seven civilians. The raid came our days after separatists in Kombone detained two military men and beheaded one of them. 1 villager was kidnapped this morning in Layouna, Waza and was found dead. 4 people were killed Roum (Tourou canton in Mayo-Tsanaga) in a Boko Haram attack. Dozens of houses and a church burned. On 15 January, in reprisal for the killing of a military man in Kombone, Cameroonian soldiers raided Kwakwa village, Bole, robbing and setting houses on fire. They raided the town again three days later, on 18 January, killing at least seven civilians. 3 people kidnapped in Toukoumaya, Waza. 02 people killed in Dzaba and Dzamazaf (Mayo-Moskota) in incursions of Boko Haram 03 people killed in Gangawa by Boko Haram 1 dead and one wounded in a Boko Haram attack in Assighassia, 30 houses burnt, 50 oxen and sheeps taken. A young assailant was killed by soldiers in Garoua. Repeated assaults between young militants and men in uniform have been recorded in Yelwa district in Garoua. On Monday, two elements of the Rapid Intervention Battalion (BIR), an elite unit of the Cameroonian army, had been seriously attacked, and it was in response to this affront that the BIR soldiers retaliated on the \"young people\". On 7 January, in retaliation for the earlier killing of a member of security forces, Cameroonian soldiers raided Kombone in Meme and reportedly killed two civilians. 01 villager died at Goldavi in a Boko Haram attack. A farmer, who was kidnapped 15 days ago, was found beheaded on his field in Tolkomari.","prevention":"The government maintained prevention efforts. A lack of coordination and funding impeded implementation of the 2017-2019 anti-trafficking national action plan. The anti-trafficking inter-ministerial committee held five meetings, compared with zero during the previous reporting period, and increased collaboration with NGOs and civil society representatives during those sessions. The government organized two press events to raise awareness of the risks of fraudulent recruitment to the Middle East that reached an unknown number of Cameroonians. Although the government did not provide specific funding to implement the national action plan, some of the activities under the action plan were included in the budgets of individual ministries. The government increased its engagement with NGOs and civil society, including through its inter-ministerial committee to combat trafficking, which was a key component of its national action plan.MINAS and the police conducted a campaign in the summer of 2017 aimed at sensitizing parents of the risk of child labor (including trafficking) and warning of potential punishment for complicit parents. To reduce the number of Cameroonian women exploited in destination countries in the Middle East, the government enhanced screening procedures at its airports, requiring proof of valid contracts in some cases. Ministry of Employment and Vocational Training (MINEFOP) officials reported vulnerable individuals used unauthorized recruiters to seek employment abroad, but the government did not investigate those suspicious recruitment practices. The government reported that MINEFOP, in conjunction with the Ministry of Labor and Social Security, monitored formal labor recruiters and revoked the licenses of an unknown number of fraudulent labor recruitment firms. The government reported it was actively negotiating with the governments of Lebanon and Qatar to finalize anti-trafficking memorandums of understanding, initiated during the previous reporting period by the Ministry of External Relations. NGOs reported the government maintained its travel ban for women traveling to the Middle East from Douala Airport. While this may have prevented some cases of trafficking, to circumvent the ban, migrant workers were reported to have traveled through Nigeria en route to the Middle East, thus increasing their vulnerability to trafficking. In partnership with an international organization, the government provided briefings on international humanitarian law, which included a trafficking component, to members of the Cameroonian armed forces prior to their deployments abroad.","prosecution":"The government increased its anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts. The 2011 anti-trafficking law criminalized all forms of labor trafficking and some forms of sex trafficking. Inconsistent with international legal standards, the law required a demonstration of threat, fraud, deception, force, or other forms of coercion to constitute a child sex trafficking offense, and therefore did not criminalize all forms of child sex trafficking. The law prescribed penalties of 10 to 20 years imprisonment and a fine of 50,000 to 1 million Central African CFA francs (CFA) ($88 to $1,760) for all forms of trafficking, which were sufficiently stringent and, with respect to sex trafficking, commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. If the offense involved a victim who was 15 years old or younger, the penalties increased to 15 to 20 years imprisonment and a fine of 100,000 to 10 million CFA ($180 to $17,610). The penalties for debt bondage ranged from five to 10 years imprisonment and a fine of 10,000 to 500,000 CFA ($18 to $880) and were also sufficiently stringent. The law was published in French and English, the two official languages of the government. The English version conftated trafficking in persons and smuggling offenses by referring to trafficking in persons offenses, as defined under international 129CAMEROONlaw, as \ufb01slavery in persons,\ufb02 while referring to smuggling-related offenses as \ufb01trafficking in persons.\ufb02 Legislation drafted in 2012 to address victim and witness protection and correct inconsistencies with international law remained pending for the sixth consecutive year. The Delegate General of National Security (DGSN) reported investigating 89 potential sex and labor trafficking cases during the reporting period that resulted in the prosecutions of 112 suspected traffickers under penal code article 342. Because article 342 prohibited both \ufb01trafficking in persons\ufb02 and \ufb01slavery in persons,\ufb02 the 112 suspects may have included smugglers. The suspects were from all 10 regions of Cameroon and were either friends or family members of the potential victims. Although most of the reported cases involved alleged labor trafficking, at least five cases included suspected sex trafficking crimes. In addition to the 112 prosecutions stemming from DGSN investigations, the Ministry of Justice reported prosecuting 17 suspected traffickers, and convicting five traffickers during the reporting period, with four of those cases being tried under article 342 and one tried under charges of fraud. These efforts compared to 13 investigations, 13 prosecutions, and two convictions during the previous reporting period. The judiciary was reportedly investigating one government official for trafficking offenses that occurred over previous years. Lawyer strikes in the Northwest and Southwest regions severely delayed court proceedings in Buea and Bamenda, where most of the trafficking cases were referred, which exacerbated judicial inefficiencies. In part because of insufficient\u0160but improving\u0160cooperation between the government and NGOs, and a weak judicial administration, some regional courts and NGOs encouraged victims to settle trafficking cases outside of court. The government reported the Ministry of Justice, the DGSN, and Ministry of Social Affairs (MINAS) had each organized efforts to educate judges, law enforcement, and social workers on the provisions relevant to trafficking included in the revised penal code, although exact numbers of officials trained were unknown. In spite of these training efforts, some trafficking offenses may have been tried as child abuse or kidnapping, which carried lesser penalties.","protection":"The government increased efforts to identify and protect victims, but did not provide comprehensive nation-wide statistics on the number of trafficking victims identified, referred, and assisted. The government reported identifying 104 potential victims through the course of law enforcement investigations, and identified and referred 32 probable child trafficking victims in Yaounde to the government-sponsored Centre d'Ecoute, where they received psycho-social services and other care. In 2017, MINAS reported identifying over 1,100 street children in urban centers throughout Cameroon who were highly vulnerable to trafficking; reunited 142 of those children with their families, placed 23 in government-sponsored care facilities, provided 40 with vocational training, and assisted 19 in resuming formal education. During 2016, the government reported identifying and providing services to 153 potential victims, although 42 of those were likely kidnapping victims. The Ministry of Health and MINAS partnered with international organizations to repatriate more than 559 Cameroonians from Libya and Niger, including potential trafficking victims. The government provided temporary shelter, medical care, and counseling to assist these individuals upon their arrival, in partnership with international organizations.NGOs reported thousands of Cameroonian workers remained in Middle Eastern countries, and that many of these workers were victims of domestic servitude or sex trafficking. In 2017, the Cameroonian embassy in Saudi Arabia coordinated with the Ghanaian embassy in Kuwait to issue return travel documents to Cameroonian trafficking victims in Kuwait in March 2018. The victims have since been repatriated. During the reporting period, the government repatriated three trafficking victims who had been held in Kuwait's detention center and one victim from Saudi Arabia.While the government had a NRS and SOPs to guide government officials in proactive identification and referral of victims of trafficking, implementation was limited and many officials had yet to be trained on the measures. MINAS had the authority to admit child trafficking victims to government institutions for vulnerable children, which offered shelter, food, medical and psychological care, education, vocational training, and family tracing. However, the government did not report referring victims to these facilities during the reporting period. Private centers funded by NGOs and regulated by MINAS provided care for an unknown number of child victims. Trafficking-specific services were not available for adult or child victims, but minors did receive services along with other vulnerable children.The government did not have a formal policy to encourage victims to participate in investigations or prosecutions of their traffickers and did not report providing counseling, legal support, or any other assistance to victims who testified during court proceedings. NGOs reported the case of one victim who had to pay to travel long distances each time their suspected trafficker appeared at trial; the government gave no assistance or protection to the victim in spite of multiple adjournments, and threats made against her by the suspected trafficker's relatives. While there were no reports the government detained, fined, or jailed any trafficking victims for unlawful acts committed as a result of being subjected to trafficking, some victims may have remained unidentified in the law enforcement system due to the limited use of the NRS and SOPs. The government could grant temporary residency status to foreign victims who, if deported, may face hardship or retribution; however, it did not report use of this accommodation during the reporting period. MINAS, through its Reception and Observation Center in Douala Bepanda, continued to provide services during this reporting period to two foreign trafficking victims identified in previous reporting periods.","recommendation":"Train law enforcement and NGO personnel on the NRS and SOPs on victim identification and referral to increase the ability of first responders to identify internal trafficking cases as well as movement-based forms of the crime; increase efforts to investigate, prosecute, and convict traffickers for all forms of trafficking\u0160including complicit officials and cases referred by NGOs\u0160under the \"slavery in persons\ufb02 provision of the penal code; increase repatriation assistance, including laissez-passer cards, to Cameroonian trafficking victims identified abroad; increase formal collaboration with NGOs on identifying and protecting victims and raising awareness of trafficking; provide training on trafficking investigations to the inter-ministerial anti-trafficking committee, and regularly convene the group; pass draft anti-trafficking legislation from 2012 that conforms to international law; amend the penal code to make a clear distinction between trafficking and smuggling; expand training for law enforcement, judiciary personnel, and social workers on the anti-trafficking section of the penal code and victim-centered investigations; publicize information to citizens on their rights as foreign workers and sources of assistance while abroad; investigate labor recruiters and agencies suspected of fraudulent recruitment\u0160including unlicensed recruiters and intermediaries\u0160and prosecute if complicit in trafficking; raise awareness of registered recruitment agencies to citizens; and develop a system to track trafficking cases and publicize relevant law enforcement and victim protection statistics.","tier":"TIER 2","traffick_profile":"As reported over the past five years, Cameroon is a source, transit, and destination country for women and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking and a source country for men in forced labor. Child traffickers often use the promise of education or a better life in the city to convince rural parents to give their children over to an intermediary, who then exploits the children in sex trafficking or forced labor. Sometimes relatives subject children to sex trafficking within the country. Homeless children and orphans are especially vulnerable to trafficking. Teenagers and adolescents from economically disadvantaged families are often lured to cities by the prospect of employment but are subjected to labor or sex trafficking. Cameroonian children are exploited in domestic service, restaurants, begging or vending on streets and highways, artisanal gold mining, gravel quarries, fishing, animal breeding, and agriculture (on onion, cotton, tea and cocoa plantations), as well as in urban transportation assisting bus drivers and in construction as errand boys, laborers, or night watchmen. Children from neighboring countries are exploited in spare parts shops or by herders in northern Cameroon and transit the country en route to Gabon and Equatorial Guinea. An international organization reported Cameroon currently has over 665,000 individuals of concern as of February 2018\u0160including refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs)\u0160who are vulnerable to trafficking due to their economic instability and lack of access to formal justice. There continued to be reports of hereditary servitude imposed on former slaves in some chiefdoms in the North region. Boko Haram's activities on the border with Nigeria and instability in neighboring CAR has contributed to the displacement of many of these refugees and IDPs. CAR refugee children are forced to engage in artisanal gold mining and sex trafficking in some areas of the East and Adamawa regions. An NGO alleged that in 2016 some officially sanctioned community watch groups (vigilance committees) may have used and recruited children as young as 12 years old. Boko Haram is a consistent terrorist threat, and continues forcibly to recruit Cameroonian children as porters, cooks, and scouts. Boko Haram also uses women and girls as forced suicide bombers and sex slaves; and boys as child soldiers.Cameroonians from disadvantaged social strata, in particular from rural areas, are exploited in forced labor and sex trafficking in the Middle East (especially Kuwait and Lebanon), as well as in Europe (including Switzerland and Cyprus), the United States, and multiple African countries (including Nigeria). Most exploited Cameroonians abroad are between the ages of 20 and 38, and come from the Northwest, Southwest, Littoral, Center, South, and West Regions. Some Cameroonian women are recruited by fraudulent labor brokers for domestic work in the Middle East but fall victim to sex trafficking or domestic servitude upon arrival. Some economic migrants in search of opportunity became victims of trafficking in Libya, or while in transit through Niger. Trafficking networks commonly consist of local community members, including religious leaders and former trafficking victims who have transitioned to perpetrators. These networks advertise jobs through the internet and other media, and recruit and sell other Cameroonians directly to families in need of domestic servants. Advocates working in the field report local awareness-raising activities targeting fraudulent recruitment have raised awareness among vulnerable populations, but have caused intermediaries to operate with greater discretion, often directing victims to travel to the Middle East through neighboring countries, including Nigeria. International organizations, NGOs, and migrants report Cameroonian trafficking networks in Morocco force women into prostitution.

The government made key achievements during the reporting period; therefore CAR was upgraded to Tier 2 Watch List. These achievements included establishing the Mixed Unit for Rapid Intervention and Repression of Sexual Violence to Women and Children (UMIRR) in Bangui; implementing a disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration program through which it identified and referred more than 3,000 child soldiers to care in partnership with an international organization; and providing training to law enforcement, judicial, and civil society actors. The government partnered with international organizations to implement standard operating procedures for identifying trafficking victims and launched an awareness raising campaign. Despite these achievements, the government did not report prosecuting or convicting any traffickers or holding accountable armed groups that recruited and used child soldiers.RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CENTRAL  AFRICAN REPUBLICIncrease efforts to investigate, prosecute, convict, and adequately sentence traffickers, specifically government officials or armed group members who unlawfully recruit child soldiers; increase anti-trafficking training for the UMIRR and the Special Criminal Court so that they can effectively identify and prosecute trafficking cases and refer victims to care; take concrete steps to provide comprehensive protection services to victims of all forms of trafficking, and ensure trafficking victims are not punished for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being subjected to human trafficking; fully implement the child soldier reintegration national action plan; hold court hearings for suspected trafficking cases; thoroughly vet incoming members of the reconstituted Central African Armed Forces (FACA) to ensure soldiers who have committed abuses against children are not reintegrated; in collaboration with NGOs and the international community, provide care to demobilized child soldiers and children in commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor; incorporate and implement programs to combat all forms of human trafficking in existing national action plans; and increase efforts to educate and encourage the public and relevant governmental authorities to identify and report trafficking victims among vulnerable populations, such as women in prostitution, street children, children associated with armed groups, and Ba'aka minorities.PROSECUTIONThe government maintained anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts during the reporting period. Article 151 of the penal code criminalized sex and labor trafficking and prescribed penalties of five to 10 years imprisonment, which were sufficiently stringent and ,with respect to sex trafficking, commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious offenses, such as kidnapping. If the offense involved a child victim of sex trafficking or forced labor similar to slavery, the prescribed penalties increased to five to 10 years imprisonment with hard labor. Articles 7 and 8 of the 2009 Labor Code criminalized forced and bonded labor and prescribed sufficiently stringent penalties of five to 10 years imprisonment. The government did not report investigating or prosecuting any trafficking cases during the reporting period, and has not convicted any traffickers since 2008. Due to years of destabilizing conftict, formal judicial capacity outside the capital has been severely limited, which has led to the use of customary dispute CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC133134CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLICresolution methods through which traditional chiefs or community leaders administer punishment for criminal acts. The government did not report any investigations, prosecutions, or convictions of government officials complicit in human trafficking offenses. The government coordinated with an international organization to organize six anti-trafficking trainings for 99 government and civil society actors including law enforcement officials, magistrates, lawyers, and heads of human rights organizations.In June 2017, supported by international organizations, the government inaugurated the UMIRR based in Bangui, composed of gendarme and police. The UMIRR focused on sexual violence against women and children in armed conftict, which included child soldiers and potential victims of forced labor or sexual exploitation. The UMIRR investigated an estimated 10 cases during the reporting period, but the government did not report the results of those investigations or if any involved trafficking crimes.PROTECTIONThe government increased efforts to identify and protect victims. The government reported identifying 39 child trafficking victims\u0160the same number identified during the previous reporting period; however, it did not report additional details on the forms of exploitation endured or whether it provided care to any of these victims or otherwise referred them for services. An international organization identified 253 victims (177 women and 76 men), but did not report whether they were victims of forced labor or sex trafficking. The Ministry of Justice, with support from an international organization, implemented standard operating procedures (SOPs) \u0160developed in 2016\u0160for the identification of victims during the reporting period; however, the government did not report the number of trained personnel familiar with the procedures, which raised questions about the effectiveness of the SOPs. The Ministry of Social Affairs continued to provide financial support to an NGO for the operation of an orphanage to house and assist children, including potential trafficking victims. The government could refer trafficking victims to NGOs that accept, but do not specialize in assisting, trafficking victims; however, the government did not report referring any victims to NGOs or other service providers for assistance. In previous years, reports indicated the government arrested and jailed individuals engaged in commercial sex, some of whom may have been trafficking victims, without verifying their ages or attempting to identify indicators of trafficking; it is unknown whether the government punished any individuals for engaging in commercial sex during this reporting period. The government did not report providing legal alternatives to the removal of foreign victims to countries where they may face hardship or retribution. During the reporting period, the government's Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration program leveraged partnerships with NGOs, international organizations, and foreign governments to assist with the reintegration of child soldiers into civilian life, and provided them medical and psychological services, in addition to vocational training. The government reported identifying more than 3,000 children associated with armed groups, including more than 800 girls, and referred them to international organizations for care in 2017. No other specialized care was available for child or adult trafficking victims in the country. The law allows victims to file civil suits against the government or their alleged traffickers for restitution; however, there were no reports this occurred during the reporting period.PREVENTIONThe government modestly increased prevention efforts during the reporting period. It partnered with an international organization to develop and launch an awareness raising campaign in 10 communes across the country and used community radio broadcasts in local languages to increase its reach. The government operated a 24-hour hotline operated by UMIRR, which was staffed by French and local language speakers; however, the government did not provide statistics on the number of calls it received. The government did not make any progress in drafting or implementing a national action plan to combat trafficking and remained without a lead entity or coordinating body to drive national anti-trafficking efforts. As part of the International Day against the Enlistment of Children in Armed Groups, the government collaborated with international organizations to launch a one-month campaign against the recruitment of child soldiers in February 2018. Additionally, the government developed a national action plan to address the recruitment and use of child soldiers, and to plan for the reintegration of victims. The 2017-2021 National Recovery and Peacebuilding Plan (RCPCA) aimed to re-establish peace and security, and support reconciliation, through disarmament and reintegration of child soldiers, in addition to promoting legal reform, seeking justice for victims, and improving access to education; however, implementation of the national action plan to address the recruitment of child soldiers and the RCPCA was limited due to budgetary shortfalls, lack of security across the country, and gaps in coordination within the government, and with donors. The government did not have an effective policy on holding foreign labor recruiters liable for fraudulent recruitment. The government did not report any measures to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts or forced labor, and did not provide anti-trafficking training for its diplomatic personnel.TRAFFICKING PROFILEAs reported over the past five years, CAR is a source and transit country for children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking, women subjected to forced prostitution, and adults subjected to forced labor. Observers report most victims are CAR citizens exploited within the country, and a smaller number transported between CAR and Cameroon, Chad, Nigeria, Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Sudan, or South Sudan. Traffickers, as well as transient merchants and herders, subject children to domestic servitude, commercial sexual exploitation, and forced labor in agriculture, artisanal gold and diamond mines, shops, and street vending. Within the country, children are at risk of becoming victims of forced labor, and Ba'aka (pygmy) minorities are at risk of becoming victims of forced agricultural work, especially in the region around the Lobaye rainforest. Girls are at risk of being exploited in commercial sex in urban centers. Girls forced into marriages are often subjected to domestic servitude, sexual slavery, and possibly sex trafficking. Surges in violent conftict in recent years resulted in chronic instability and the displacement of more than one million people, increasing the vulnerability of men, women, and children to forced labor and sex trafficking. In 2017, almost 700,000 people remained internally displaced inside the country and approximately 540,000 individuals sought 135CHADrefuge in neighboring countries. This is an increase from 402,000 internally displaced people and 464,000 refugees the previous year. An international organization has identified more than 10,000 refugees residing in CAR and more than 45,000 refugee returnees spontaneously returned to CAR in 2017. The government's lack of control and presence in much of the country impairs its ability to effectively combat the worst forms of child labor nationwide. There is limited information about the forms of exploitation believed to have increased as a result of ongoing conftict. The recruitment and use of children by armed groups, at times through force, has been widely documented; however, there were no verified cases of government-affiliated forces recruiting or using child soldiers during the reporting period. An international organization reported between 6,000 and 10,000 children were recruited by armed groups during the latest conftict through 2015. The government ratified the UN Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conftict in September 2017 and ratified the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child in July 2016. The Ministry of Justice announced measures to incorporate into national legislation provisions to criminalize actions committed by members of armed groups to include the recruitment or use of children in armed conftict. United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA) has more than 10,000 peacekeeping forces and police in CAR to protect civilians, provide security, support humanitarian operations, and promote and protect human rights, among other objectives; however, allegations of sexual abuse by peacekeepers within MINUSCA persisted during the reporting period. The UN investigated six alleged sexual exploitation cases of MINUSCA peacekeepers, police, and UN civilian staff. More than 100 cases were reported since MINUSCA's inception in September 2014. Peacekeepers from the DRC and the Republic of Congo allegedly perpetrated the majority of these 50 reported cases.

The government did not provide anti-trafficking training or guidance for its diplomatic personnel.","prosecution":"The government maintained minimal law enforcement efforts. In May 2017, the president signed the revised penal code into law, which criminalized labor and sex trafficking offenses through a variety of new criminal provisions. Article 330 criminalized the recruitment, transfer, harbor, or receipt of a person for the purpose of trafficking and prescribed penalties of five to 10 years imprisonment and a fine of 100,000 to 5 million Central African CFA francs (CFA) ($180 to $8,810); these penalties were sufficiently stringent and, with regard to sex trafficking, commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. Articles 327 and 331 together criminalized \ufb01involuntary labor\ufb02 or servitude through the use of force, fraud, or coercion and prescribed a penalty of two to 10 years imprisonment, or a fine of 100,000 to 1 million CFA ($180 to $1,760), or both; these penalties were sufficiently stringent. Articles 328 and 331 together criminalized slavery through the use of force, fraud, or coercion and prescribed penalties of 10 to 20 years and 200,000 to 10 million CFA ($350 to $17,610); these penalties were sufficiently stringent and commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. Article 335 and 336 together criminalized the prostitution of adults through the use of force, fraud, or coercion and the exploitation of children through prostitution and prescribed penalties of two to five years imprisonment and 100,000 to 2 million CFA ($180 to $3,520); these penalties were sufficiently stringent but not commensurate with other serious crimes, such as rape. The African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, the January 1991 Ordinance on the Reorganization of the Armed Forces, and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child criminalized recruitment of children younger than 18 years; punishment for those who violate this provision was at the discretion of military justice officials. In March 2018, the president signed an ordinance that criminalized trafficking in persons and created the National Commission for the Fight against Trafficking in Persons. The National Assembly was reviewing proposed revisions of the Child Protection Code, Labor Code, and Family Code, which contained additional provisions criminalizing child trafficking and increasing protections for children working in the informal sector.136CHADAlthough the government did not collect comprehensive law enforcement data, it reported investigating one potential trafficking case involving an 11-year-old girl, and it did not prosecute any suspected traffickers. The government did not convict any traffickers for the second consecutive year. During the previous year, the government investigated and prosecuted one marabout, a teacher at a Quranic school, for the alleged forced begging of two Quranic school students; however, prolonged strikes and closures of the courts due to a lack of government funding stemming from a severe economic crisis resulted in the suspension of cases across the country, including the trafficking case. The government provided no further information on the progress of this case. The government did not report any investigations, prosecutions, or convictions of government officials complicit in human trafficking offenses; however, NGOs reported some local officials' suspected involvement in trafficking during the reporting period. In November 2017, government law enforcement officials cooperated with INTERPOL in an international anti-trafficking investigation that resulted in the release of over 500 potential trafficking victims, but authorities did not share any investigation or victim referral data. ","protection":" The government maintained minimal efforts to identify and protect trafficking victims, but worked to improve its capacity to undertake such efforts by initiating the implementation of a victim identification and referral procedure. Acknowledging Chad's public sector services were unavailable for most of the reporting period, especially outside of N'Djamena, officials did not report identifying or referring any victims to services, compared with two victims identified and referred to a public hospital during the previous year. The government's regional child protection technical committees, located in eight of Chad's 23 regions, also did not report identifying or referring any child victims of trafficking to protective services. The government established formal victim identification and referral procedures, consisting of law enforcement officials or other first responders notifying the Ministry of Justice's Child Protection Directorate, international organizations, and NGOs of potential trafficking cases; however, dissemination and implementation were unknown. Due to budgetary constraints, the government did not disseminate its guide for security forces and civil society, which outlined steps to assist suspected trafficking victims with a victim-centered approach. The guide also detailed the roles of different institutions during an investigation and provided guidance on social services, health centers, and shelters, as well as information about how to reunite victims with their families when possible. The Ministry of Women, Family, and National Solidarity, in partnership with an international organization operated reception centers throughout the country. During the reporting period, these shelters provided temporary housing, food, and education to victims of gender-based violence and other crimes, including potential victims of trafficking. The government did not have a formal policy to offer temporary or permanent residency for foreign victims of trafficking, and did not report providing services to those victims. There were no reports the government punished trafficking victims for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being subjected to human trafficking; however, without widespread implementation of formal victim identification procedures, some victims may have remained unidentified in the law enforcement system.","recommendation":"Vigorously investigate and prosecute suspected trafficking offenders according to Presidential Ordinance 00618; increase training on the trafficking investigation guide and new criminal code to law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and magistrates; disseminate standard operating procedures for the identification and referral of trafficking victims to security services, law enforcement, and civil society; work with NGOs and international organizations to increase the provision of protective services to all trafficking victims; regularly convene the National Commission against Trafficking in Persons and inter-ministerial committee, and include civil society, international organizations, and NGOs in the meetings; and raise public awareness of trafficking issues, particularly at the local level among tribal leaders and other members of the traditional justice system.","tier":"TIER 2 WATCH LIST","traffick_profile":"Chad is a source, transit, and destination country for children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking. The country's trafficking problem is primarily internal and frequently involves children being entrusted to relatives or intermediaries in return for promises of education, apprenticeship, goods, or money, and subsequently subjected to forced labor in domestic service or herding. Children are subjected to forced labor as beggars in urban areas, agricultural laborers, gold mining in the north of the country, charcoal production, and as domestic workers. In some regions, children are involved in catching, smoking, and selling fish. Some children who leave their villages to attend traditional Quranic schools, known as mouhadjirin, are forced into begging, street vending, or other labor. Child herders, some of whom are victims of forced labor, follow traditional routes for grazing cattle and, at times, cross ill-defined international borders into Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Sudan, and Nigeria. Some of these children are sold in markets for use in cattle or camel herding. In some cases, child herders are subjected to forced labor by military or local government officials. Chadian girls travel to larger towns in search of work, where some are subsequently subjected to child sex trafficking or are abused in domestic servitude; child sex trafficking is also a concern among refugees and internally displaced people in Chad. Forced labor in prisons occurred. According to an international organization, Chad hosts over 606,000 refugees, internally displaced persons, asylum-seekers, and refugee returnees; populations that are vulnerable to trafficking due to their economic instability and lack of access to support systems. NGOs report the Nigerian terrorist group Boko Haram and its offshoot Islamic State-West Africa are involved in child trafficking.

The government continued to delay the adoption of a national action plan. OHRRNM served as the secretariat for the senior-level national coordinating committee; the national committee held a session in December 2017, compared to no sessions in 2016. The committee's working-level operational team held monthly meetings; the labor inspectorate was included in the national committee and the operational team. OHRRNM reported insufficient resources and staff. OHRRNM allocated 197,000 kunas ($31,620) for prevention efforts in both 2016 and 2017, including 4,000 kunas ($640) for the NGO-run hotline. Observers reported the NGO-run hotline operated only from 10am to 6pm due to inadequate financial support. The government monitored its anti-trafficking efforts, produced annual reports, and posted information on ministries' websites. OHRRNM allocated 6,250 kunas ($1,000) for EU Anti-trafficking Day and organized roundtables on child trafficking. The government held awareness campaigns targeting students and teachers, distributed informative materials, and aired trafficking programs on television and radio. The government continued to organize awareness-raising events for social workers, NGOs, government officials, and workers from the tourism industry. The MOI operated a specific unit consisting of 80 prevention officers for prevention activities and continued outreach programs for students and the service industry. The government continued to implement an awareness building campaign targeted towards Roma, and OHRRNM continued a 156CUBAcampaign sensitizing the public, including potential customers, to the reality that persons engaged in prostitution may be trafficking victims. The law regulated the operation of labor recruitment agencies.","prosecution":"The government maintained law enforcement efforts. Article 106 of the criminal code criminalized sex and labor trafficking and prescribed penalties of one to 15 years imprisonment, which were sufficiently stringent and, with respect to sex trafficking, commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. The government investigated nine cases involving 17 suspects (seven cases involving 11 suspects in 2016). The government prosecuted 12 defendants in 2017 (11 in 2016). Courts convicted four traffickers (five in 2016) with sentences ranging between two years and eight months and four years and six months. The Supreme Court separately convicted three perpetrators with final verdicts (two in 2016). Lower courts originally convicted the traffickers under article 106 but the Supreme Court later held that the charges were more properly child pandering (article 162) and sexual exploitation of a child under 15 (article 168); two 155CROATIAof the three defendants received sentences lower than the prescribed three-year minimum for trafficking of children. The three perpetrators were sentenced to community service without incarceration, two years imprisonment, and three years and ten months imprisonment, respectively. The government reported improved procedures, including a new electronic case management system, for internally sharing information about trafficking cases. Law enforcement personnel under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Interior (MOI) conducted proactive investigations on commercial sex establishments, particularly during the tourist seasons, and joint investigations with the labor inspectorate in the construction and agriculture sectors. Law enforcement conducted spot checks of suspicious vehicles for signs of trafficking. The government trained 244 border and traffic police on trafficking issues, including developmental considerations in working with victims of child trafficking. The government maintained law enforcement cooperation with foreign governments, EUROPOL, INTERPOL, and the Southeast Law Enforcement Center, but did not specify the nature of that international cooperation. The government did not report any investigations, prosecutions, or convictions of government officials complicit in trafficking offenses.","protection":"The government increased victim protection efforts. The government identified 29 victims (30 in 2016). Of these, three were victims of forced labor, eight of sex trafficking, seven of forced criminality, and 11 of multiple types of exploitation (13 forced labor victims, 16 sex trafficking victims, and one victim of both in 2016); seven were girls and seven were boys (eight girls and three boys in 2016); six women and nine men (13 women and six men in 2016); and 10 were foreign victims (eight in 2016). In January 2018, police identified 59 victims from Taiwan, six from Croatia, and one from Bosnia and Herzegovina subjected to forced labor and forced criminality in an illegal call center; the government reported the case remained ongoing. A multi-disciplinary national referral mechanism provided standard operating procedures for identifying and referring victims to services. According to the national referral mechanism, first responders carried out the preliminary identification of potential victims and contacted one of four regional mobile teams consisting of social workers and NGO representatives that traveled to assess the potential victims in person and coordinated victim care and placement. MOI officially recognized victims based on collaboration with first responders and the regional mobile team and specialized police officers responsible for child protection were called in to work with potential child victims. NGOs involved in mobile teams reported two years of training were required to join the mobile team and stated they needed more funding to train staff in a shorter amount of time. The government adopted a protocol that further defined roles and responsibilities for victim identification. Observers reported the need to increase proactive identification efforts, including towards asylum-seekers and seasonal workers. The government and NGOs provided victims protection and assistance, including shelter, medical assistance, legal assistance, psycho-social support, rehabilitation, and reintegration services. The government-funded two NGO-run shelters, one for adults and one providing specialized support for children; these shelters accommodated one child and seven adults (one child and three adults in 2016). The Ministry of Demography, Family, Youth and Social Policy (MDFYSP) accommodated an additional 14 child victims, nine in foster homes and five in group homes. The government reported plans to move toward implementation of foster care and away from using state child care institutions to mitigate traffickers targeting children from state orphanages. MDFYSP allocated approximately 360,000 kunas ($57,785) to support the NGO-run shelters and an additional 63,000 kunas ($10,110) for monthly living allowances for victims, compared to approximately 400,000 kunas ($64,210) in 2016. Additionally, the Office for Human Rights and Rights of National Minorities (OHRRNM) allocated 20,000 kunas ($3,210) for direct assistance to victims. Foreign victims had access to the same services as domestic victims and were entitled to receive a renewable residence permit for a year; however, no foreign victims requested temporary residence status in 2017 (one in 2016). The government adopted a protocol that outlined procedures for the voluntary repatriation of victims. The Office of the Chief State Prosecutor maintained written instructions on non-penalization of victims and seven Victim and Witness Support Offices at county courts provided assistance during criminal proceedings, including the ability to testify via video link, the ability to enter into the witness protection program, referrals to specialized institutions, logistical assistance, and measures to prevent re-traumatization. No victims entered witness protection in 2017. OHRRNM created a roster of pro bono legal counsel available for victims, but observers reported a shortage of lawyers trained to represent trafficking victims. The government trained police officers on victim-centered investigations; however, experts reported that some judges lacked sensitivity and an understanding of the impact of psychological trauma on victims' ability to consistently and clearly relate the circumstances of their exploitation and inappropriately dismissed as unreliable victim testimony. The government did not report the number of victims that cooperated with investigations in 2016 or 2017. The government reported no trafficking victims filed for compensation but all victims were informed of their right to compensation.

In the previous reporting period, three of the four NGOs in the MCG withdrew because NGOs were not given a substantive role, meetings were infrequent, and two NGOs did not meet financial requirements. The MCG drafted amendments to strengthen civil society participation in the MCG. The MCG formed a working group on improving victim protection.

A multi-disciplinary national referral mechanism (NRM) provided standard operating procedures for identifying and referring victims to services, including an operational manual and written guidance for first responders. The NRM required first responders to conduct preliminary identification of potential victims and refer potential victims to the Social Welfare Services (SWS). SWS officers provided potential victims with information and notified the ATU, who officially identified victims. The ATU interviewed 80 potential victims (169 in 2016); the government identified 64 potential victims, NGOs identified ten, two self-identified, and five were identified by the public (NGOs identified 52 potential victims and the government identified 117 potential victims in 2016). Observers reported the ATU lacked transparency in the identification process, but authorities reported using internal identification manuals based on international standards and guidelines. Specialized personnel in the police anti-trafficking unit, including a forensic psychologist, conducted interviews with potential and identified victims before taking an official statement. Observers reported potential forced labor victims remained undetected partly due to a lack of resources for labor inspectors. Observers also reported a lack of proactive identification efforts at the Kofinou Reception Center and reported anecdotal accounts of exploitation. Authorities reported fully screening all individuals awaiting deportation for trafficking indicators. The government organized three training sessions attended by approximately 220 government officials on victim identification and referral. The government also trained first responders in a region with a high concentration of migrant laborers in agriculture and separately trained marriage officers and social welfare officers on proactive identification. The government spent \u2022265,770 ($319,060) to operate the SWS-run shelter, compared to \u2022294,940 ($354,070) in 2016. This amount did not include salaries for the SWS-run shelter staff. The government also allocated \u2022263,550 ($316,380), compared to \u2022254,560 ($305,600) in 2016, in financial assistance to trafficking victims through a public benefit scheme known as Guaranteed Minimum Income. SWS evaluated the needs of victims and potential victims and referred them to the appropriate government agencies and NGOs for assistance. SWS operated a specialized shelter for sex trafficking victims and victims of forced marriage with the capacity to accommodate 15 victims; the SWS-run shelter accommodated 30 official and potential victims in 2017 (53 in 2016). Victims may stay for one month or longer, as appropriate, in the shelter for a reftection period. The SWS-run shelter allowed adult victims to leave the shelter voluntarily after an assessment conducted by ATU. Observers reported a lack of immediate support and accommodation for potential victims identified outside of SWS business hours and did not want to cooperate with law enforcement. Observers also reported that slow processing of SWS evaluations sometimes created obstacles for victims to access services. The government signed a memorandum of cooperation with an NGO and allocated \u202260,000 ($72,030) to the NGO to open the first open house for female sex trafficking victims, designed primarily as a halfway accommodation for recognized sex trafficking victims while searching for permanent residence after leaving the state-run shelter. Additionally, the government allocated \u202230,000 ($36,000), compared to \u202215,000 ($18,000) in 2016, to an NGO-run shelter to accommodate female victims of labor trafficking and female victims not eligible for accommodation at the SWS-run shelter, as well as for longer-term accommodation of female victims of sex trafficking after they leave the shelter. The government also provided a rent subsidy and a monthly allowance for all victims and partnered with NGOs to provide apartments for male victims. The law entitled victims to psycho-social services, health care, translation and interpretation services, education, vocational training, and financial assistance. Observers continued to report improved service quality for victims but reported victims faced obstacles in accessing health care due to bureaucratic delays. In the previous reporting period, observers reported staff at the SWS-run shelter were not adequately trained to provide the necessary psychological support to victims; however, the government organized monthly trainings between SWS-run shelter staff and clinical psychologists from the Ministry of Health in 2017. Employment counselors trained to handle sensitive cases sought suitable employment for each victim but finding employment for victims remained a challenge. The law entitled child victims to education, placement into foster homes, and specialized medical and psycho-social care; the government provided support to two one victim (two in 2017). In the previous reporting period, the government streamlined the process for providing financial support to victims and prioritized public benefit applications from trafficking victims. NGOs confirmed all identified victims received a monthly allowance and reported no delays in receiving allowances. Victims received emergency financial assistance in cases of delayed distribution of monthly allowances.The government voluntarily repatriated or granted residence permits and work authorization to foreign victims including those who decided after their reftection period not to cooperate with the police. The government extended the residence and work permit for three victims (four in 2016) and granted asylum to four victims (three in 2016). The government permitted victims to leave Cyprus and return for trial, and police remained in contact with victims while they were abroad; two victims left Cyprus but returned to testify in trial (one in 2016). The law entitled victims to witness protection through a request made by the police to the Attorney General; no requests were made in 2016 or 2017. Police officers escorted victims to court proceedings, but experts reported police sometimes did not share information and updates on court procedures or did not keep appointments at promised times creating anxiety among victims. The law entitled victims to closed-door trials, a partition to separate victims from their traffickers, remote testimony, and the use of video recorded testimonies for child victims; 161CYPRUShowever, none of the methods were used in 2016 or 2017. Twenty-six victims assisted law enforcement in investigations (14 in 2016). Victims can receive restitution through civil suits; the government covered travel and accommodation expenses for a victim to testify in the first civil case against a trafficker but civil courts acquitted the trafficker.

Women, primarily from Eastern Europe, Vietnam, India, and Sub-Saharan Africa, are subjected to sex trafficking. Sex trafficking occurs in private apartments and hotels, on the street, and within commercial sex outlets in Cyprus including bars, pubs, coffee shops, and cabarets. Some female sex trafficking victims are recruited with false promises of marriage or work as barmaids or hostesses. Foreign migrant workers\u0160primarily from South and Southeast Asia\u0160are subjected to forced labor in agriculture. Migrant workers subjected to labor trafficking are recruited by employment agencies and enter the country on short-term work permits; after the permits expire, they are often subjected to debt bondage, threats, and withholding of pay and documents. Asylum-seekers from Southeast Asia, Africa, and Eastern Europe are subjected to forced labor in agriculture and domestic work. Unaccompanied children, children of migrants, Roma, and asylum-seekers are especially vulnerable to sex trafficking and forced labor.

The United States does not recognize the \ufb01TRNC,\ufb02 nor does any other country except Turkey. The area administered by Turkish Cypriots continues to be a zone of impunity for human trafficking. Turkish Cypriot authorities do not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and are not making significant efforts to do so. If the \ufb01TRNC\ufb02 were assigned a formal ranking in this report, it would be Tier 3. Turkish Cypriots did not keep statistics on law enforcement efforts against trafficking offenders. The area administered by Turkish Cypriots lacked shelters for victims and social, economic, and psychological services for victims. Local observers reported authorities were complicit in facilitating trafficking, and police continued to retain passports upon arrival of women working in nightclubs. The \ufb01Nightclubs and Similar Places of Entertainment Law of 2000\ufb02 provided the most relevant legal framework vis-\u00e0-vis trafficking and stipulated nightclubs may only provide entertainment such as dance performances. Additionally, trafficking-related cases would be tried under the \ufb01TRNC criminal code,\ufb02 which prohibited living off the earnings of prostitution or encouraging prostitution and forced labor. However, Turkish Cypriots rarely enforced this law and rarely prosecuted nightclub owners, bodyguards, or clients. In October 2017, the owner of a \ufb01nightclub\ufb02 was arrested and on trial for \ufb01encouraging prostitution\ufb02 and \ufb01living off the earnings of prostitution.\ufb02 Additionally, in February 2018, the Mayor of Nicosia Turkish Municipality closed four \ufb01nightclubs\ufb02 citing absence of established \ufb01legal\ufb02 frameworks and reports of sexual exploitation. The authorities made no efforts to punish labor recruiters or brokers involved in the recruitment of workers through knowingly fraudulent employment offers or excessive fees for migration or job placement. There was no \ufb01law\ufb02 that punished traffickers who confiscate workers' passports or documents, change contracts, or withhold wages to subject workers to servitude. Turkish Cypriot authorities did not allocate funding to anti-trafficking efforts, police were not trained to identify victims, and authorities provided no protection to victims. Police confiscated passports of foreign women working in nightclubs and issued them identity cards, reportedly to protect them from abuse by nightclub owners who confiscated passports. Observers reported women preferred to keep their passports but police convinced them to render passports to avoid deportation. Foreign victims who voiced discontent about the treatment they received were routinely deported. Trafficking victims serving as material witnesses against a former employer were not entitled to find new employment and resided in temporary accommodation arranged by the police, but experts reported women were accommodated at nightclubs. The Turkish Cypriot authorities did not encourage victims to assist in prosecutions against traffickers, and all foreign victims were deported. If the police requested a victim to stay to serve as a witness, the police were required to provide temporary accommodation; however, the only shelter for trafficking victims closed in July 2016.During the reporting period, \ufb01TRNC\ufb02 authorities issued 1,084 six-month \ufb01hostess\ufb02 and \ufb01barmaid\ufb02 work permits for individuals working in nightclubs and two pubs operating in the north (1,314 in 2016). As of January 2018, there were 400 women working under such permits (342 as of January 2017). Nightclub owners hired female college students during the reporting period to bypass the cap on the number of employees legally permitted in each club and avoid taxes and monitoring. Observers reported 162CZECH REPUBLICauthorities did not consistently document the arrival of women intending to work in nightclubs. Most permit holders came from Moldova, Morocco, Belarus, Russia and Ukraine, while others came from Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kyrgyzstan, Paraguay, Tajikistan, Tanzania, and Uzbekistan. Reportedly some \ufb01parliament\ufb02 members were clientele of the nightclubs. Women were not permitted to change location once under contract with a nightclub, and Turkish Cypriot authorities deported 331 women (445 in 2016) who curtailed their contracts without screening for trafficking. While prostitution is illegal, female nightclub employees were required to submit to weekly health checks for sexually transmitted infections, suggesting recognition and tacit approval of the prostitution industry. Victims reported bodyguards at the nightclubs accompanied them to health and police checks, ensuring they did not share details of their exploitation with law enforcement or doctors. The \ufb01law\ufb02 that governed nightclubs prohibited foreign women from living at their place of employment; however, most women lived in dormitories adjacent to the nightclubs or in other accommodations arranged by the owner. The \ufb01Nightclub Commission,\ufb02 composed of \ufb01police\ufb02 and \ufb01government officials\ufb02 who regulate nightclubs, prepared brochures on employee rights and distributed them to foreign women upon entry. The \ufb01Nightclub Commission\ufb02 met monthly and made recommendations to the \ufb01Ministry of Interior\ufb02 regarding operating licenses, changes to employee quotas, and the need for intervention at a particular establishment. The \ufb01Social Services Department\ufb02 in the \ufb01Ministry of Labor\ufb02 continued to run a hotline for trafficking victims; however, it was inadequately staffed by one operator who had not received any training on trafficking. An expert reported trafficking victims were afraid to call the hotline because they believed it was linked to authorities. Forty-seven female \ufb01nightclub\ufb02 workers were repatriated after having sought help from the authorities due to complaints regarding their working conditions (30 in 2016). During the reporting period, the \ufb01TRNC\ufb02 issued 945 work permits to domestic workers (2,383 in 2016). Turkish Cypriots made no efforts to reduce demand for commercial sex acts or forced labor.The \ufb01TRNC\ufb02 is a destination for women from Central Asia, Eastern Europe, and Africa who are subjected to forced prostitution in nightclubs licensed and regulated by the Turkish Cypriot administration. Nightclubs provide a significant source of tax revenue for the Turkish Cypriot administration; media reports estimated nightclub owners pay between 20 and 30 million Turkish lira ($5.3 million and $7.9 million) in taxes annually. This presents a conftict of interest and a deterrent to increased political will to combat trafficking. Men and women are subjected to forced labor in industrial, construction, agriculture, domestic work, restaurant, and retail sectors. Victims of labor trafficking are controlled through debt bondage, threats of deportation, restriction of movement, and inhumane living and working conditions. Labor trafficking victims originate from Nigeria, Zimbabwe, China, Pakistan, Philippines, Turkey, Turkmenistan, and Vietnam. Migrants, especially those who cross into the Turkish Cypriot community after their work permits in the Republic of Cyprus have expired, are vulnerable to labor trafficking. Roma children and Turkish seasonal workers and their families are also vulnerable to labor exploitation. Women issued permits for domestic work are vulnerable to forced labor. Men and women enrolled as university students, particularly from Sub-Saharan African countries, are vulnerable to sex trafficking and forced labor. As in previous years, observers reported a number of women entered the \ufb01TRNC\ufb02 on three-month tourist or student visas and engaged in prostitution in apartments in north Nicosia, Kyrenia, and Famagusta; some may be trafficking victims. Migrants, asylum-seekers, refugees, and their children are also at risk for sexual exploitation.RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TURKISH CYPRIOT AUTHORITIES:Enact \ufb01legislation\ufb02 prohibiting all forms of human trafficking; screen for human trafficking victims, including in nightclubs and pubs; increase transparency in the regulation of nightclubs and promote awareness among clients and the public about force, fraud, and coercion used to compel prostitution; provide funding to NGO shelters and care services for the protection of victims; investigate, prosecute, and convict \ufb01officials\ufb02 complicit in trafficking; provide alternatives to deportation for victims of trafficking; and acknowledge and take steps to address conditions of forced labor, including among domestic workers."},"Equatorial Guinea":{"April":0.0,"Asylum Seekers":0.19,"August":0.0,"December":0.0,"February":1.0,"Friday":0.0,"Global Population":1308.97,"January":0.0,"July":1.0,"June":0.0,"Life Expectancy":58.4,"March":0.0,"May":1.0,"Monday":2.0,"November":0.0,"October":1.0,"Population below $1.90 a day":"NA","Saturday":1.0,"September":0.0,"Sunday":0.0,"Thursday":0.0,"Tuesday":0.0,"Violence against civilians":4,"Wednesday":1.0,"fatalities":["0","1","1","0"],"government_effort":"NA","introduction":"The Government of Equatorial Guinea does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so; therefore Equatorial Guinea remained on Tier 3.

However, the government did not prosecute any suspects and has never convicted a trafficker under its 2004 anti-trafficking law.

The leader claimed it was a state assassination. The ruling party deny the allegation. 30 of the 150 activists on trial on Tuesday 13\/2 had been tortured so badly that they could not stand up.","prevention":"The government increased efforts to prevent trafficking. For the first time in six years, the government convened its anti-trafficking inter-ministerial committee, although the government did not report any follow-on actions. Authorities used multiple media platforms including radio and television to raise public awareness of trafficking. In March 2018, the government began airing anti-trafficking programming on the country's two primary television channels multiple times per day. In November and December 2017, with technical support from an international organization and private sector actors, the government implemented the second phase of its anti-trafficking program, and funded training for more than 170 community leaders across the country, intended to create a civil society network knowledgeable about trafficking and able to identify and prevent human trafficking. This program built on victim identification training for 600 community leaders and law enforcement officials in December 2016. Prostitution is legal in the country and, in an attempt to decrease exploitation of vulnerable individuals, the government continued implementing regulations requiring all commercial sex establishments to register and provide contracts to their workers. However, the government did not make efforts to reduce demand for commercial sex acts. The Ministry of Labor continued to implement regulations for all companies to sign formal labor contracts with their employees; however, it did not publicize information on companies that were out of compliance. Using these regulations, the general director of the National Financial Research Agency and Ministry of Labor inspected and revoked business licenses for an undisclosed number of Chinese-owned construction companies for labor violations. The government did not implement any programs to address forced child labor despite having 13 labor inspectors dedicated to documenting labor infractions. The government did not provide anti-trafficking training for its diplomatic personnel. ","prosecution":"The government maintained minimal anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts. The 2004 Law on the Smuggling of Migrants and Trafficking in Persons criminalized labor and sex trafficking and prescribed penalties of 10 to 15 years imprisonment, which were sufficiently stringent and, with regard to sex trafficking, commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. The government investigated two cases of suspected child trafficking, compared with one investigation during the previous reporting period; however, both cases were discovered to be illegal adoptions through the course of the investigations. As in the previous year, authorities did not report any prosecutions and the government has never convicted a trafficker; the district attorney reported prosecuting a total of only 120 criminal cases for any crime during the reporting period. The government did not report any investigations, prosecutions, or convictions of government employees complicit 178ERITREAin human trafficking offenses; however, corruption and official complicity in trafficking crimes remained significant concerns, inhibiting law enforcement action during the year. Unlike previous years, the government did not conduct anti-trafficking trainings for law enforcement officials. ","protection":"The government maintained limited efforts to protect victims, but increased efforts to screen vulnerable populations for signs of trafficking. The government did not identify or refer any victims to protective services, and did not have formal procedures to identify or refer trafficking victims. Although the 2004 anti-trafficking law mandated the government to provide legal assistance, psychological and medical care, lodging, food, access to education, training, and employment opportunities to trafficking victims, it did not report providing these services to any trafficking victims, as none were formally identified. However, the government provided funding to an NGO shelter for female victims of violence including likely trafficking victims. Unlike previous years in which officials immediately deported migrants, authorities screened more than 200 irregular migrants intercepted at sea for signs of trafficking and provided temporary shelter, food, and medical services before coordinating with foreign embassies to repatriate the migrants to their countries of origin. Officials increased coordination with foreign embassies, and collaborated on four cases of suspected trafficking victims prior to repatriating the individuals after discovering that they were cases of illegal adoptions. The government had no formal policies to provide foreign trafficking victims legal alternatives to their removal to countries where they might face retribution or hardship.Police and border officials solicited bribes from detainees\u0160the majority of whom were young foreign men, although children and women were also detained\u0160and deported those who did not pay. In 2017, there were no verified reports of trafficking victims being detained, fined, or jailed for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of their being subjected to trafficking; however, due to a lack of formal victim identification procedures and the reports of officials requiring bribes from detainees, some unidentified trafficking victims were likely penalized. ","recommendation":"Research the extent and nature of human trafficking within the country; dedicate resources to implement the national action plan to combat trafficking in persons; develop and implement formal procedures to identify and refer trafficking victims to care, especially victims of child sex trafficking, and among child laborers, undocumented immigrants, and women in prostitution; ensure consistent application of existing procedures for screening foreigners and notifying embassies before deportation to ensure trafficking victims are provided appropriate care and safe, voluntary repatriation; expand the scope of the anti-trafficking public awareness campaign to include outreach campaigns across the country; use the 2004 anti-trafficking law to prosecute and convict traffickers, including complicit officials; train social workers, law enforcement, and immigration officials in the use of trafficking victim identification and referral procedures; increase funding or in-kind support to shelters for trafficking victims, including male victims; regularly convene the inter-ministerial anti-trafficking commission and create technical working groups focused on increasing coordination between government ministries, law enforcement, presidents of the community, and NGOs. ","tier":"TIER 3","traffick_profile":"As reported over the past five years, Equatorial Guinea is a source country for women and girls vulnerable to sex trafficking and a destination country for men, women, and children, who may be vulnerable to forced labor. The majority of trafficking victims are exploited in the cities of Malabo, Bata, and Mongomo, where relative wealth and security make the country an attractive destination for central and West African migrant workers. Equatoguinean and foreign women are exploited in commercial sex in these cities, often by foreigners. Lower oil prices and oil production in recent years have caused a deep contraction of the country's economy leading to a decreased government budget for social welfare programming and shrinking formal economic activity. LGBTI youth are often left homeless and stigmatized by their families and society, which increases their vulnerability to trafficking. Children from nearby countries\u0160primarily Nigeria, Benin, Cameroon, Togo, and Gabon\u0160may be subjected to forced labor as domestic workers, market laborers, vendors, and launderers. Women from Cameroon, Benin, other neighboring countries, and the Caribbean are recruited for work in Equatorial Guinea and subjected to forced labor or forced prostitution. Civil society actors report that Ethiopian women are exploited for domestic servitude by family members in Malabo. Chinese women migrate to Equatorial Guinea for work or to engage in prostitution, and some are subjected to passport confiscation, increasing their vulnerability to forced labor. General corruption and complicity by government officials in trafficking-related offenses occurred during the reporting period.

However, the government did not share information on its overall anti-trafficking efforts. The government continued to subject its nationals to forced labor in its citizen militia and compulsory national service by forcing them to serve for indefinite or otherwise arbitrary periods under harsh conditions.

It continued to subject its nationals to forced labor in its citizen militia and compulsory national service. In recent years, the government reportedly educated its citizens on the dangers of trafficking through awareness-raising events and poster campaigns through the Women's Association, Youth Association, and Workers' Federation; however, such efforts continued to conftate transnational migration and human trafficking. While the Proclamation of National Service 11199 prohibited the recruitment of children younger than 18 years of age into the armed forces and applied sufficiently stringent penalties for this crime, reports alleged children younger than age 18 were sent to Sawa military and training academy for completion of their final year of secondary education. The country remained without an independent monitoring body to verify ages of new recruits into governmental armed forces and lacked transparency on efforts to ensure children did not participate in compulsory activities amounting to military service or other forms of forced labor. The government did not report on its efforts to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts or forced labor, or its provision of anti-trafficking training for its diplomatic personnel.","prosecution":"The government maintained negligible anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts. The Eritrean Penal Code of 2015 criminalized some forms of trafficking in persons. Article 315 criminalized trafficking in women and young persons for sexual exploitation, which was punishable by up to seven years imprisonment; these penalties were sufficiently stringent, but not commensurate with punishments prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. Article 297 criminalized enslavement and prescribed penalties of seven to 16 years imprisonment, which were sufficiently stringent. Labor Proclamation 118 of 2001 criminalized forced labor and child labor. Penalties listed in the penal code under article 299 prescribed penalties from six to 12 months imprisonment or a fine up to 50,000 Nakfa ($3,330).The government did not report investigating, prosecuting, or convicting suspected traffickers during the reporting period; however, it stated a large number of Eritreans were imprisoned for the crime. The government did not report any investigations, prosecutions, or convictions of government officials complicit in human trafficking, but sources indicated Eritrean military officers remained complicit in trafficking offenses. In December 2017, unconfirmed reports claimed the government arrested 44 military officials for conspiracy to subject Eritreans to trafficking. The government did not report providing any trafficking-specific training for judicial, prosecutorial, or law enforcement personnel, and officials continued to conftate transnational migration and human trafficking crimes. ","protection":"The government did not report any efforts to identify or protect trafficking victims. Eritrean officials had no procedures to proactively identify trafficking victims among vulnerable groups, particularly Eritreans deported from other countries and those fteeing the country, primarily to Sudan, Ethiopia, and Djibouti; some of these nationals were vulnerable to being arrested, detained, harassed, or forcibly recalled into national service. The government did not report developing a systematic mechanism for the referral of identified trafficking victims to care. It did not provide foreign victims with legal alternatives to their removal to countries where they faced retribution or hardship.","recommendation":"Develop, enact, and enforce an anti-trafficking statute that criminalizes all forms of trafficking, including sex trafficking and forced labor, clearly differentiating between emigration, smuggling, and human trafficking; enforce existing limits on the length of active national service to 18 months and cease the use of threats and physical punishment for non-compliance; investigate allegations of conscripts being forced to perform duties beyond the scope of the national service program and hold accountable those responsible, including complicit officials; exclude children younger than 18 at Sawa training academy from participation in activities that amount to military service; ensure victims and their families are not punished for crimes committed as a result of being subjected to trafficking or for fteeing government-sponsored forced labor; extend existing labor protections to persons performing national service and other mandatory citizen duties; with assistance from international organizations, provide training to all levels of government, including law enforcement officials and diplomats, on identifying and responding to trafficking crimes; and provide protective services to trafficking victims.","tier":"TIER 3","traffick_profile":"As reported over the past five years, Eritrea is a source country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor. To a significantly lesser extent, Eritrean adults and children are subjected to sex and labor trafficking abroad. Perennially, thousands of Eritreans who fted the country sought to escape human rights abuses, including arbitrary arrest and detention, lack of due process, and religious persecution; were in search of better economic opportunities; or hoped to avoid the often indefinite periods of the government's forced labor through its national policies and mandatory programs. Eritrea's strict exit control procedures and limited issuance of passports, which compel those who cannot obtain exit visas or documents to travel clandestinely, increase its nationals' vulnerability to trafficking abroad, primarily in Sudan, Ethiopia, and to a lesser extent Djibouti and Libya, with the ultimate goal of seeking asylum in Europe or at a minimum, obtaining refugee status in Ethiopia, Kenya, Egypt, or Uganda; some also strive to reach the United States. Proclamation 82 of 1995 requires persons aged 18 to 40 years to perform compulsory active national service for a period of 18 months \u0152 six months of military training followed by 12 months of active military and development tasks in military forces or in a government-run work unit, including the Eritrean defense forces. However, the 18-month timeframe is arbitrary and unenforced; many individuals are not demobilized from government work units after their mandatory period of service but rather forced to serve indefinitely under threats of detention, torture, or familial reprisal. In 2012, the 180ESTONIAgovernment instituted a compulsory citizen militia, requiring medically fit adults up to age 70 not currently in the military to carry firearms and attend military training or participate in unpaid national development programs, such as soil and water conservation projects. Working conditions are often harsh and sometimes involve physical abuse.All 12th-grade students, including some younger than age 18, are required to complete their final year of secondary education at the Sawa military and training academy; those who refuse to attend cannot receive high school graduation certificates, attain higher education, or be offered some types of jobs. Government policy bans persons younger than 18 from military conscription; however, according to some organizations outside of Eritrea, the government in some instances includes children younger than age 18 in groups sent to Sawa. Reports from an international organization in previous years indicated some recruits may have been subjected to beatings, abuse, and rape, though there are no confirmed cases of this kind in the current reporting period. The government continued Maetot, a national service program in which secondary-school children are assigned to work in public works projects, usually within the agricultural sector, during their summer holidays. Some Eritrean children are subjected to forced labor, including forced begging, and some women and girls are subjected to sex trafficking within the country.Unaccompanied minors are increasingly at risk of being subjected to violence and exploitation. Children who attempt to leave Eritrea are sometimes detained or forced to undergo military training despite being younger than the minimum service age of 18. Some Eritrean women and girls travel to Gulf States for domestic work but are subsequently subjected to sex trafficking. Smaller numbers of Eritrean women and girls are subjected to sex trafficking in Sudan; reportedly, some Eritrean men are vulnerable to sex trafficking in Israel. International criminal groups kidnap vulnerable Eritreans living inside or in proximity to refugee camps, particularly in Sudan, and transport them primarily to Libya, where they are subjected to human trafficking and other abuses, including extortion for ransom. Some migrants and refugees report being forced to work as cleaners or on construction sites during their captivity. Reports allege Eritrean diplomats, particularly those posted in Sudan, provide travel documents and legal services to Eritrean nationals in exchange for bribes or inftated fees, potentially facilitating their subjection to trafficking. Some Eritrean military and police officers are complicit in trafficking crimes along the border with Sudan.

The government demonstrated increasing efforts compared to the previous reporting period; therefore Ethiopia remained on Tier 2. The government demonstrated increasing efforts by assisting in the interception of more than 10,000 individuals vulnerable to trafficking and convicting more than 180 traffickers. The government improved oversight of recruitment agencies; more strenuously penalized illegal recruitment activity; and increased its efforts to raise awareness on trafficking and trafficking-related crimes through its community conversations project and media campaigns. However, the government did not meet the minimum standards in several key areas.

In 2016, parliament approved a second National Human Rights Action Plan spanning 2016-2020, which included various activities to curb trafficking, including a media campaign and increased efforts in urban centers to assist women and child victims; however, for the second consecutive year, the government did not allocate funding dedicated to the action plan's implementation. The anti-trafficking task force increased its activity by meeting monthly and organizing itself into four subgroups focused on awareness raising and monitoring, reintegration, research and evaluation, and prosecution. The Attorney General's Office, in conjunction with an international organization and academic institution, published a trafficking manual, screened an anti-trafficking movie in various districts in Amhara, and conducted a training for task force members on best practices in public awareness-raising. The SNNPR government trained 1,500 employees on generating awareness in their communities and instituted a new program to inform residents on how to collect and protect their new passports. Local and regional state governments, in collaboration with an international organization, continued to host and facilitate hundreds of \ufb01community conversations\ufb02 sessions throughout the country, reaching hundreds of thousands of Ethiopians in attempts to raise awareness of trafficking. Officials in the Amhara region produced television and radio public service announcements and interviews to elevate the public's awareness of the dangers of trafficking, which, in addition to the general public, strategically reached religious and traditional leaders, elders, and media personnel. However, the aforementioned awareness campaigns did not reach all parts of rural Ethiopia, and there remained a serious lack of awareness of the dangers of irregular migration and human trafficking. The revised employment exchange proclamation came into effect in the previous reporting period\u0160paving the way for greater oversight of private employment agencies, placement of labor attach\u00e9s in Ethiopian embassies abroad, and establishment of an independent agency to identify and train migrant workers; however, the revised proclamation was still not fully implemented during the current reporting period. 185FIJITwo new components of the proclamation stipulated rules for licensing and advertising for overseas employment, in addition to penalties for employment agencies that contravened the revised employment proclamation (e.g. false advertisement, passport confiscation, and rights violations). In January 2018, the government ceased its 2013 ban on the recruitment of low-skilled domestic workers to the Middle East; since the lifting of the ban, labor officials received 300 applications for private employment agencies to commence operations in Ethiopia. The revised proclamation required employment agencies to deposit 1 million Ethiopian birr ($36,760) in a bank as insurance, which would be used to assist and repatriate trafficking victims. The government applied stringent application requirements and determined only 20 agencies were in compliance and merited licensing. In 2017, the government employed 2,560 labor inspectors who carried out approximately 55,000 labor inspections at formal work sites; however, it did not report numbers of license or agency suspensions or labor law violations as a result of these inspections. For the second consecutive year, the government remained in negotiation with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates on bilateral employment agreements; Ethiopia had such agreements in place with Qatar, Kuwait, and Jordan. These agreements require signatories to commit to ethical recruitment, legal remedies against those who violate the law, and equal protection of Ethiopian workers, to include equal wages for equal work, reasonable working hours, and leave time. Memoranda remained in place with neighboring African countries\u0160particularly Djibouti, and on an ad hoc basis with Kenya and Sudan\u0160and aimed to address joint border management to include repatriation assistance for trafficking victims; however, these did not explicitly address workers' rights. Ethiopian officials continued efforts to implement a 2012 law requiring registration of all births nationwide; however, the lack of a uniform national identity card continued to impede implementation of the law and allowed for the continued issuance of district-level identity cards, which is subject to fraud. The government did not report efforts to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts or child sex tourism during the reporting period. Together with clothing designers, the government developed a certification program to label clothing as child labor-free so buyers can support businesses that do not use child labor. A foreign donor and facilitator provided Ethiopian troops with anti-trafficking training prior to their deployment abroad on international peacekeeping missions.","prosecution":"The government maintained its anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts; however, it continued to focus on transnational labor trafficking, with negligible efforts to investigate or prosecute sex trafficking or internal forced labor cases. The 2015 anti-trafficking Proclamation, No.9092015, criminalized labor trafficking and sex trafficking, prescribing penalties of 15 to 25 years imprisonment and a fine of 150,000 to 300,000 Ethiopian birr ($5,515 to $11,030), which were sufficiently stringent and, with respect to sex trafficking, commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. For aggravated offenses, the law increased penalties to 25 years to life imprisonment, along with a fine of 200,000 to 500,000 Ethiopian birr ($7,350 to $18,380). Aggravated offenses included any exploitation that was committed against a child, woman, or anyone impaired; resulted in physical or psychological harm; committed using drugs or weaponry; or, carried out by a government official, civil servant, or family member. The Employment Exchange Services Proclamation No.9232016, which governed the work of licensed labor recruitment agencies, contained various penalties for an employment agency's failure to comply with its provisions, and provided that furnishing falsified evidence or documents or advertisements in order to recruit or deploy a worker entails criminal liability; however, it did not specify what portion of the Criminal Code will apply.For calendar year 2017, federal and regional justice officials convicted 182 traffickers under the 2015 anti-trafficking proclamation, and 82 verdicts remained pending at the close of the reporting period; this is compared to 640 convictions in 2016 and 69 convictions in 2015, in which some cases in previous years likely involved smuggling and other crimes often conftated with trafficking. The government did not report any investigations, prosecutions, or convictions of public officials allegedly complicit in human trafficking offenses. Financial and capacity constraints continued to impede data compilation by regional police, and poor communication and coordination between the regions and the federal government also hindered effective law enforcement efforts. The government continued to partner with international organizations to conduct and fund trainings for regional and federal government personnel on the 2015 anti-trafficking proclamation, victim-centered investigations, and detecting trafficking crimes. The government spent 1 million Ethiopian birr ($36,760) to train 110 labor inspectors and funded the purchase of 500,000 Ethiopian birr ($18,380) worth of monitoring equipment for their inspections. 184ETHIOPIA","protection":"The government modestly increased its efforts to protect trafficking victims. The government continued to partner with international organizations and NGOs to identify and provide services to victims; although it did not allocate funding to these entities, it provided some in-kind support, including land, facilities, staff, and other logistical support services on an ad hoc basis. The 2009 charities and societies proclamation, which prohibits organizations receiving more than 10 percent of their funding from foreign sources from engaging in activities that promote human rights, restricted some NGOs' ability to provide protective services to trafficking victims. The government remained without a formal mechanism to proactively identify potential trafficking victims. In 2017, federal and regional governments intercepted 10,655 persons in the border areas of Ethiopia, the vast majority of whom were intending to depart for work in Gulf states and other African countries, and many were minors\u0160populations most vulnerable to trafficking. The government supported 167 children at risk of, or exploited in, sex trafficking in Amhara. The government continued to jointly operate two migration response centers in Afar and Metema with an international organization, and provided rent-free usage of the facilities. The government maintained operation of child protection units in Addis Ababa and several major cities; staff was trained in assisting vulnerable children, including potential trafficking victims. Police and civil service transport workers\u0160trained to recognize child trafficking victims\u0160referred the majority of intercepted children to local shelters. In 2017, one NGO cooperated with the local police to identify traffickers, and intercepted, rehabilitated, and provided psycho-social support for more than 1,000 internal child trafficking victims. Another NGO\u0160focused on transnational cases\u0160maintained provisions of comprehensive re-integration services, familial reunification, medical care, mental health counseling, legal counsel, food and housing, and vocational training for women and children. There continued to be a dearth of care available for male trafficking victims. During the year, the government, in collaboration with an international organization, repatriated more than 10,000 Ethiopian migrants from Saudi Arabia. In addition, an international organization helped repatriate and provided post-arrival assistance for more than 2,690 Ethiopians from the Gulf states. Since the government lacked funding to repatriate all of its nationals, it assisted with victim identification services in respective countries and sometimes negotiated discounted air fares for returnees. Some Ethiopian diplomatic missions in the Gulf states and Sudan had shelters for trafficking victims on respective mission compounds where they could stay temporarily, and the missions engaged with host government authorities on the individual's behalf. The 2015 anti-trafficking proclamation established a fund to support victim protection and rehabilitation efforts; however, the government did not report efforts to begin financial allocations to and administration of the fund. Implementation of the national mechanism for referring repatriated trafficking victims to social services remained limited for the second consecutive year. Under the national referral mechanism, the anti-trafficking task force is the lead coordinator for referring trafficking victims to services, but an international organization and other government entities play vital roles. The mechanism incorporates special identification and screening tactics for child trafficking victims, in addition to the profiling of voluntary returnees and deportees at the Bole International Airport. During the reporting period, the anti-trafficking task force, in partnership with an international organization, promulgated the referral mechanism in two critical regions: Tigray and Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People's Region (SNNPR). In addition to the national referral mechanism, regional governments work with local and federal police to refer victims to shelters and other protective services. However, the government continued to lack standardized proactive screening procedures to detect potential trafficking victims. While officials reported encouraging victims in some cases to assist in the investigation and prosecution of their traffickers, the number of victims who took an active role in these processes was unknown and it was unclear whether the government provided them legal assistance or other support to facilitate their doing so. The 2015 anti-trafficking proclamation extends to trafficking victims protections outlined under the Witness and Whistleblowers Protection Proclamation (No.6992010), which included protection from prosecution for crimes committed as a result of being subjected to trafficking. However, Ethiopian law did not provide alternatives to the deportation of foreign victims to countries where they may face hardship or retribution. There were no reports any trafficking victims were deported without proper screening or detained, fined, jailed, or otherwise penalized for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being subjected to human trafficking in 2017; however, the government housed at police stations some victims who were waiting to provide testimony in their respective trafficking cases. ","recommendation":"Increase efforts to prosecute and convict traffickers for both sex trafficking and internal trafficking offenses; continue to implement and train law enforcement and judicial officials on the anti-trafficking proclamation; develop standardized procedures for the proactive identification and referral of internal trafficking victims; fully implement the 2016 national referral mechanism and promulgate it to all critical regions; extend protective services to male victims of trafficking; fully implement the overseas employment proclamation, by continuing to strengthen oversight of overseas recruitment agencies, assigning and training labor attaches, and investigating and prosecuting illicit recruiters; expand trafficking training for labor officials who validate employment contracts or regulate employment agencies; improve screening procedures in the distribution of national identification cards and passports to prevent their fraudulent issuance to children; incorporate information on human trafficking and labor rights in Middle Eastern and other countries into pre-departure training provided to all migrant workers; ensure awareness campaigns reach all parts of rural Ethiopia; and, allocate funding toward full implementation of the national action plan.","tier":"TIER 2","traffick_profile":"As reported over the past five years, Ethiopia is a source and, to a lesser extent, destination and transit country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking. Scarce economic opportunities and dire poverty coupled with familial encouragement compels thousands of Ethiopians, including a substantial percentage of minors, to transit, primarily via Djibouti or Somalia, to Yemen and onward to Saudi Arabia; increasingly to cross the border illegally into Kenya, destined for South Africa for ftights to Ecuador with a final destination of the United States or Canada; or, least commonly of the three routes, to travel through Sudan and Libya with the hope of crossing the Mediterranean and ultimately reaching Europe. Reports suggest that along these three routes, irregular Ethiopian migrants who began their journeys voluntarily are subsequently vulnerable to sexual exploitation or forced labor in transit countries and in their intended destinations. An international organization reported an uptick in the number of minors traveling along the eastern migration route towards Yemen, hoping to reach Saudi Arabia. Typically, young men and women migrate west via Sudan aiming for Europe, while young women tend to travel through Eritrea or Djibouti to secure domestic work in Saudi Arabia. The Ethiopian government lifted its October 2013 ban on domestic worker employment in the Gulf states in January 2018; the ban has contributed to irregular migration and trafficking. Saudi Arabia remains the primary destination for irregular migrants, representing 80-90 percent of Ethiopian labor migration; reportedly, over 500,000 Ethiopians reside there. From March to November 2017, Saudi Arabia offered an amnesty period, declaring that all irregular migrants can voluntarily leave the country; an international organization reported more than 100,000 migrants returned to Ethiopia during this timeframe, of which nearly 65,000 were deportees and more than 70 percent male. Many Ethiopian women working in domestic service in the Middle East are subjected to severe abuses, including physical and sexual assault, denial of salary, sleep deprivation, passport confiscation, and confinement. Ethiopian women who migrate for work or ftee abusive employers in the Middle East are also vulnerable to sex trafficking. Ethiopian men and boys migrate to the Gulf states and other African nations, where some are subjected to forced labor. An international organization reported the severe drought in 2015-2016 increased instances of internal trafficking. Furthermore, ongoing displacement among Ethiopia's regions created vulnerability to trafficking. For example, following protracted conftict in the Oromia region in late 2016, Djibouti reported a sharp increase in ethnic Oromo asylum-seekers entering the country. Current accounts document ethnic Tigrayans move from the Amhara region into Tigray to escape ethnically-based unrest in Amhara. Internally displaced persons\u0160a population vulnerable to trafficking\u0160numbered more than one million in 544 displacement sites across nine regions. Families continue to play a major role in financing irregular migration, and may force or coerce their children to go abroad or to urban areas in Ethiopia for employment. An international organization assesses that most traffickers are small local operators, often from the victims' own communities, but that well-structured, hierarchical, organized crime groups are also responsible for irregular migrants becoming highly susceptible to trafficking. Labor recruiters target young people from Ethiopia's vast rural areas with promises of a better life. Girls from Ethiopia's impoverished rural areas are exploited in domestic servitude and commercial sex within the country, while boys are subjected to forced labor in traditional weaving, construction, agriculture, and street vending. Addis Ababa's central market is the site of numerous brothels, where some young girls are exploited in commercial sex. Ethiopian girls are exploited in domestic servitude and commercial sex in neighboring African countries, particularly Djibouti and Sudan. Ethiopian boys are subjected to forced labor in Djibouti as shop assistants, errand boys, domestic workers, and street beggars, in addition to forced criminality. Child sex tourism continues to be a problem in major hubs, including Addis Ababa, Bahir Dar, Hawassa, and Bishoftu."},"Gabon":{"April":1.0,"Asylum Seekers":"1","August":1.0,"December":0.0,"February":0.0,"Friday":0.0,"Global Population":2119.28,"January":0.0,"July":0.0,"June":0.0,"Life Expectancy":66.19,"March":0.0,"May":0.0,"Monday":0.0,"November":0.0,"October":0.0,"Population below $1.90 a day":"3.4","Saturday":0.0,"September":0.0,"Sunday":0.0,"Thursday":0.0,"Tuesday":1.0,"Violence against civilians":2,"Wednesday":1.0,"fatalities":["0","0"],"government_effort":"NA","introduction":"The Government of Gabon does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so; therefore Gabon was downgraded to Tier 3. Despite the lack of significant efforts, the government took some steps to address trafficking, including identifying more child victims compared with the previous reporting period and referring them to care, and providing resources to some shelters, particularly those that serve children at higher risk of becoming trafficking victims. However, the government did not convict any traffickers and, for the fifth consecutive year, it did not enact a proposed amendment to criminalize adult trafficking. It also decreased for the fourth consecutive year the amount of funding allocated for victim services; did not increase efforts to identify, refer, or provide services to adult victims; and did not conduct any public awareness raising campaigns.","iso3":"GAB","latitude":["-0.7167","0.3901"],"location":["Port Gentil","Libreville"],"longitude":["8.7833","9.4544"],"notes":"On 14 August, a greek tanker carrying 17 Georgian sailors was possibly attacked and the sailors kidnapped by pirates in Gabonese waters. Around 25 April, in Sotega district of Libreville, a police officer beat a woman over the head during an altercation between the members of the two families as part of a land dispute.","prevention":" The government decreased prevention efforts. The inter-ministerial child trafficking committee continued to investigate child trafficking offenses, but insufficient funding severely hampered its efforts. The government drafted a five-year action plan to combat child trafficking in 2016, but the government has not validated it. The plan did not include actions to address adult trafficking. Unlike in previous years, the government did not conduct any awareness-raising campaigns to sensitize the public on the dangers of trafficking. Unlike the previous year, the government collaborated with an international organization to prevent trafficking through the training of border officials. The government did not make any discernible efforts to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts or forced labor. The government, with foreign donor support, provided anti-trafficking training to approximately 450 Gabonese troops prior to their deployment abroad on an international peacekeeping mission in the Central African Republic. The government investigated 37 Gabonese peacekeepers who allegedly sexually exploited civilians. In addition to receiving military disciplinary action, the government referred suspects in eight cases to the civilian court system for prosecution. The government did not provide anti-trafficking training for its diplomatic personnel.","prosecution":"The government decreased anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts. Existing laws did not criminalize all forms of human trafficking. Law 0904 to Prevent and Combat Child Smuggling criminalized selling children, subjecting them to debt bondage, and bringing them into the country and unlawfully employing them, and prescribed penalties of a \ufb01custodial sentence\ufb02 and a fine of 10 million to 20 million Central African CFA francs (CFA) ($17,610 to $35,220). Title 1, article 4 of the Gabonese labor code criminalized forced labor and prescribed penalties of one to six months imprisonment or a fine of 300,000 to 600,000 CFA ($530 to $1,060). Neither law provided sufficiently stringent sentences. Penal code article 261 criminalized adult and child sex trafficking and prescribed penalties of two to five years imprisonment and a fine. Law 2163-94 also criminalized forced prostitution of adults and prescribed penalties of two to 10 years imprisonment. These penalties were sufficiently stringent and commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. For the fifth consecutive year, the government did not pass the 2013 draft amendment to law 0904 to criminalize the trafficking of adults and explicitly criminalize sex trafficking.The government reported investigating one trafficking case but did not report initiating any prosecutions, a decrease from eight investigations and prosecutions in the previous reporting period. The government did not convict any traffickers for the fifth consecutive year. Only the high court was authorized to hear trafficking cases because it is a crime equivalent to murder; however, the high court was backlogged with cases and did not routinely meet, in part because of a shortage of funding. In addition, due to a lack of training and widespread corruption, the prosecutorial judges tasked with investigating trafficking cases often did not investigate cases brought to their attention, creating significant obstacles to prosecuting trafficking crimes. Furthermore, data on anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts was limited, in part due to poor communication between ministries. The government did not report any investigations, prosecutions, or convictions of government employees complicit in human trafficking offenses; however, corruption and official complicity in trafficking crimes remained significant concerns. Some judges received bribes from alleged traffickers and actively delayed or dismissed trafficking cases. The government did not report efforts to investigate a Gabonese diplomat posted to the United Kingdom in 2016, alleged to have exploited a worker in domestic servitude. During the reporting period, the inter-ministerial committee conducted a two-day training for immigration officials on identifying and investigating trafficking cases. In contrast with previous years, the government did not report cooperation with foreign law enforcement on transnational trafficking cases.","protection":"The government increased efforts to identify and assist child victims, while efforts to protect adult victims remained negligible. Officials identified and referred 65 child labor trafficking victims to shelters that provided medical, legal, and psychological care, compared with 15 in 2016. The government did not report identifying any adult trafficking victims, and provided no specific trafficking-related services. The government decreased funding to NGOs that provided shelter and services to victims for the fourth consecutive year, and there continued to be a lack of shelter space to accommodate all trafficking victims. The government continued to fund two NGO-run shelters offering services to orphans and street children vulnerable to trafficking, providing an unknown amount of funding and in-kind support, including funding for social workers, medical support, psychological services, legal assistance, tuition, and food and furniture vouchers. However, the government did not report referring any child trafficking victims to these facilities. Other NGOs assisting trafficking victims relied primarily on donations from churches and private companies to finance their services, and some government workers used personal funds to assist victims. The same services were available for male, female, foreign, and Gabonese victims, including those repatriated from abroad. There were no government or NGO-192THE GAMBIArun shelters specifically designated for adult victims, although adult victims could potentially access government services for victims of domestic abuse or other forms of violence; however, the government did not report such victims doing so during the year. Some shelters could have provided services to adults and some allowed child trafficking victims to remain after they reached 18 years of age; however, the government did not report referring any adults to such facilities during the reporting period. Officials have the authority to permit adult male victims to leave shelters unchaperoned but not adult female victims, allegedly for their safety. The Ministry of Family, Social Protection, and National Solidarity, in coordination with foreign embassies, assisted in the repatriation of 42 foreign child trafficking victims. Gabonese authorities reported that a lack of cooperation with source-country governments on funding the repatriation of foreign victims identified in Gabon greatly lengthened the repatriation process; foreign trafficking victims remained in Gabonese shelters on average between six months and three years before repatriation. If victim repatriation was not an option, the Ministry of Social Affairs could provide a victim with immigration relief and resettle them in Gabon, but the government did not report any victims utilizing this legal alternative. The government encouraged victims to cooperate with authorities to provide testimony for the prosecution of alleged traffickers. Prosecutors, police, and magistrates routinely took victims' testimony at the time of the arrest of the suspected traffickers or identification of the victim, an approach that is neither victim-centered, nor considered the most effective. While the government has sought restitution for trafficking victims in the past, it did not report doing so during the reporting period. Victims could file civil suits against their traffickers, but there were no known cases of such action, in part due to lack of knowledge of the option. There were no reports the government detained, fined, or jailed victims for unlawful acts committed as a result of being subjected to trafficking; however, due to negligible effort to identify adult trafficking victims, some victims may have remained unidentified in the law enforcement system.","recommendation":"Increase efforts to prosecute and convict traffickers, including complicit officials and sex traffickers; use existing penal code articles criminalizing forced labor to investigate, prosecute, and convict traffickers who exploit adults in forced labor; draft and enact legislation to criminalize all forms of trafficking; expand training for social workers, law enforcement, labor inspectors, and judicial staff to include the identification and investigation of adult trafficking; increase financial or in-kind support to government-run and NGO shelters; increase communication among ministries to facilitate improved case management and data collection; reinvigorate collaboration with foreign governments to investigate transnational trafficking cases and repatriate foreign victims; train social workers and service providers on best practices in the provision of care for trafficking victims; expand the existing inter-ministerial committee's mandate to include adult trafficking, and include efforts to address adult trafficking in the next national action plan; expand awareness-raising campaigns to include information on adult trafficking; and develop a system to track cases and publicize relevant law enforcement and victim protection statistics, including on trafficking offenses prosecuted under other articles of the penal code.","tier":"TIER 3","traffick_profile":"As reported over the past five years, Gabon is primarily a destination and transit country for West and Central African men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking and\u0160to a lesser extent\u0160a source country for children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking. Boys are forced to work as street vendors, mechanics, or in microbus transportation and the fishing sector. Girls are subjected to domestic servitude and forced labor in markets or roadside restaurants. Gabonese children are exploited as market vendors in eastern provinces of the country. West African women are forced into domestic servitude or prostitution in Gabon. Some foreign adults seek the help of smugglers for voluntary labor migration to Gabon but are subsequently subjected to forced labor or prostitution after arriving via plane or boat with falsified documents. Some victims transit Gabon en route to Equatorial Guinea. Traffickers appear to operate in loose, ethnic-based criminal networks, at times involving female traffickers\u0160some of whom are former trafficking victims\u0160in the recruitment and transportation of victims from their countries of origin. In some cases, families willingly give children to intermediaries who fraudulently promise education or terms of employment they ultimately do not provide, instead subjecting the children to forced labor through debt bondage. Some traffickers procure falsified documents for child trafficking victims to make them appear older than 18 years old to avoid prosecution under the child trafficking law.

The government continued to demonstrate serious and sustained efforts during the reporting period; therefore Georgia remained on Tier 1. The government demonstrated serious and sustained efforts by updating law enforcement guidelines for victim identification, including on the treatment of victims, screening for indicators at border posts, and victim-centered interview practices. The government identified more victims and continued to provide comprehensive care. During the year, the government created and issued a grant for an NGO to organize awareness-raising activities in 10 cities and separately provided a new allocation to two NGOs to identify and support the reintegration of street children. Although the government meets the minimum standards, victim identification remained inadequate for children in exploitative situations on the street and Georgian and foreign workers in vulnerable labor sectors. As in previous years, the labor inspectorate operated with an unclear mandate, which inhibited inspectors' ability to effectively investigate employers. No trafficking victims have ever received restitution from their traffickers and observers reported the government lacked public transparency, as it did not provide public assessments of its own anti-trafficking efforts.","iso3":"GEO","latitude":["41.7183","41.8192","41.7429","42.2639","41.4741","42.5794","41.4021","41.9277","42.4144","41.7183","42.2276","41.6772","42.1128","41.7183","41.9842","43.0458","41.7183","42.2276","42.7123","41.7183"],"location":["Tbilisi","Lagodekhi","Gurjaani","Kutaisi","Marneuli","Oni","Akhalkalaki","Kaspi","Martvili","Tbilisi","Tskhinvali","Adigeni","Dirbi","Tbilisi","Gori","Mestia","Tbilisi","Tskhinvali","Ochamchire","Tbilisi"],"longitude":["44.8306","46.2784","45.8011","42.6999","44.7896","43.4425","43.4834","44.4223","42.3792","44.8306","43.9686","42.7085","43.875","44.8306","44.1158","42.7278","44.8306","43.9686","41.4686","44.8306"],"notes":"On 28 November, reportedly, a journalist was attacked by members of Georgian Dream in Tbilisi while reporting on elections. This was one of the two attacks on journalists during the day. On 28 November, a gunshot was fired against the office of the opposition party UNM in Lagodekhi. The UNM claims the person who fired was among those who were celebrating the winning of the Government-backed candidate Salome Zurabishvili in the second round of the presidential elections. On 28 November, gunshots were fired in the direction of the opposition party UNM in Chumlaki, Gurjaani. On 28 November, an elections observer was attacked in Kutaisi by Georgian Dream coordinators as she tried to report a violation. [Coded according to the version of the civilian] On 24 November, according to a citizen, the police beat him up because of his support to opposition in Marneuli. [coded according to the version of the citizen] On 22 November, the local coordinator of the United Opposition, which includes UNM was stabbed in Oni by unidentified people. On 30 October, unidentified men attacked members of United National Movement in Akhalkalaki. Five people were hospitalized as a result of the attack. UNM claims the attackers were related to a Georgian Dream MP Endzel Mokoyan. [Coded according to the UNM version] On 29 October, unidentified men attacked the UNM supporters in Kaspi. The man claims he was attacked by Georgian Dream supporters because of his political views. [Coded according to the version of the civilian] As reported on 23 October, a man accused police of beating in Martvili. According to the man, he was detained and beaten by several policemen in the car and then at the police station. The police did not make any statement regarding the issue. [Coded according to the version of the civilian] On 30 September, a local activist was killed in Tbilisi. There are allegations that the murder happened on xenophobic grounds. On 29 September, South Ossetian police forces arrested a Georgian woman along the occupation line. As reported by Georgian side, she was beaten in detention, territory controlled by South Ossetia de-facto authorities [Coded according to the Georgian version] It was reported on 29 July, that a member of European Georgia was beaten up in Adigeni. He alleges that he attempted to end the fight between young men, after which men who were supporters of Georgian Dream came to him and beat him up. [coded according to the victim's version] On 5 June, two Georgian citizens were detained by Russian border guards near the village of Dirbi, Georgia and taken into neighboring South Ossetia. The arrest sparked protest from the Georgian government and eventually led to the individuals' release. On 27 May, former president of judo federation fired arms at judokas who demanded resignation of the president of Judo Federation. The shooter was arrested. One person was wounded. On 17 May, guns were fired at the office of Jehovah's Witnesses in Gori by unidentified people. On 26 March, an armed local citizen in Chuberi, Mestia Municipality, broke into the territory of the Nenskra Hydropower Plant (HPP) office and fired gunshots as a sign of protest against construction of the HPP. No one was injured. On 19 March, a group of Georgian March activists attacked a group of journalists belonging to Rustavi-2 network outside of the station's headquarters in Tbilisi. The fight was instigated by a religious joke said during a newscast. On 22 February, a Georgian citizen died in a hospital in Tskhinvali after being detained and held in Tskhinvali prison. Georgian side claims he was killed while Ossetian side claims he fell on the stairs and died of heart failure later in the hospital. On 2 February, two unidentified men reportedly kidnapped a captain of a Turkish fishery ship in the area of Ochamchira port, Abkhazia. Allegedly, the attackers stopped his car, forced the driver to leave and took the car with the passenger; the vehicle was later found with a shot through windshield. The motive or further information about his whereabouts have not been released yet. On 10 January, in Tbilisi, an activist and director of a Police Reform NGO and his wife were assaulted and beaten by unidentified assailants.","prevention":"The government increased prevention efforts. The Interagency Council on Combating Trafficking in Persons (TIP Council) monitored implementation of the 2017-2018 national action plan, but observers reported the TIP Council did not provide public assessments and lacked public transparency. In October, the government created and issued a 25,000 lari ($9,580) grant to an NGO to organize awareness-raising activities in 10 cities. The government continued to disseminate leaftets on various trafficking issues at border crossings, tourism information centers, metro stations, and public service halls throughout the country. Government officials funded and participated in a number of television, radio, and print media programs to raise awareness. The government organized anti-trafficking information meetings in villages and towns, presenting to different target groups, including primary school and university students, minorities, internally displaced persons, and journalists. The government continued to fund an anti-trafficking hotline operated by MOIA and another hotline operated by the State Fund that received calls from trafficking victims. The hotlines received 118 calls in 2017 and led to the identification of one victim. MOJ provided 54,000 lari ($20,690) to two NGOs to identify and support the reintegration of street children; the NGOs identified 105 children living on the streets. Authorities provided three street children with government identification, as authorized in a June 2016 law providing free identification documents to street children, which allowed them to receive public assistance, including health and education services for children who are undocumented foreign citizens. MOJ issued 13 temporary identification documents to homeless children, one permanent identity card and five passports to known or suspected trafficking victims. The Law on Labor Migration regulated the operation of labor recruitment agencies; however, the labor inspectorate continued to have an unclear mandate due to a lack of substantive labor laws and unclear authority to conduct unannounced inspections. The labor inspectorate inspected 64 businesses and fined 610 foreign laborer recruiters for failing to provide information on the Georgian citizens assisted to find work outside the country and hosted three meetings with private businesses to explain signs of trafficking, legal consequences, and other forced labor issues. The government did not report efforts to reduce the demand for commercial sex and forced labor. The government provided anti-trafficking training for its diplomatic personnel and its armed forces prior to deployment as peacekeepers.","prosecution":"The government maintained law enforcement efforts. The Law on Combating Trafficking in Persons and article 143 of the criminal code criminalized all forms of trafficking and prescribed penalties ranging from seven to 20 years imprisonment, which were sufficiently stringent and, with regard to sex trafficking, commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. The law defined trafficking broadly to include illegal adoption without the purpose of exploitation. The government investigated 23 new cases (16 in 2016). The government prosecuted four defendants, all for sex trafficking, compared to one for sex trafficking and one for forced begging in 2016. The government convicted four traffickers (one in 2016); traffickers received sentences between 10 and 13 years imprisonment. In addition, the government extradited two alleged traffickers.The government maintained several specialized units, including the Anti-Trafficking and Illegal Migration Unit within the Central Criminal Police Department and four mobile groups and task forces under the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MOIA). Observers reported the task force in Adjara was understaffed, faced regular staff turnover, and lacked experienced investigators and female investigators. Experts reported the government continued to develop capabilities to investigate trafficking cases but required additional advanced training for complex cases involving money laundering, organized crime, and digital evidence. The government reported the inability to conduct anti-trafficking efforts within the breakaway territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The government did not report any investigations, prosecutions, or convictions of government employees complicit in human trafficking. All police cadets received basic training on trafficking issues. 195GEORGIA","protection":"The government slightly increased protection efforts. The government identified 12 victims (three victims in 2016); 10 victims of sex trafficking and two victims of forced labor (three sex trafficking victims in 2016); all victims were female in 2016 and 2017; and one was a child. The government updated law enforcement guidelines for victim identification, including the treatment of victims, screening for indicators at border posts, and victim-centered interview practices. Mobile groups and task forces screened 682 individuals working at hotels, bars, nightclubs, and bathhouses for trafficking indicators and another 55 individuals deemed as \ufb01high-risk\ufb02 from working at businesses that violated labor standards. Authorities also screened 3,085 Georgian nationals deported from other countries for trafficking indicators at the international airport and border crossings. A multi-disciplinary national referral mechanism (NRM) provided standard operating procedures for identifying and referring victims to services. Law enforcement officially recognized victims who participated in investigations and the Permanent Group assessed and officially recognized victims who declined to participate in investigations. The Permanent Group comprised a five-member board of non-governmental and international organization representatives and was required by statute to convene and assess a potential victim within 48 hours. An NGO provided initial psychological care and temporary shelter for potential victims awaiting official victim status, but an international organization reported an increase in identified victims would cause delays in the 48-hour identification period and constraints in accommodating potential victims. Observers reported the NRM worked effectively and demonstrated strong cooperation between law enforcement and victim assistance agencies; however, victim identification of children in exploitative situations on the street and Georgian and foreign workers in vulnerable labor sectors remained inadequate.The government operated two specialized shelters and provided medical aid, psychological counseling, legal assistance, childcare services, reintegration support, and a one-time financial payment of 1,000 lari ($380) to victims. Child trafficking victims received the same assistance specialized for minors, in addition to custodial care, education, and family reintegration programs. The government allocated 211,600 lari ($81,070) to the anti-trafficking shelters in Tbilisi and Batumi and other victim assistance programs, compared to 269,220 lari ($103,150) in 2016. Victims could initially stay at the shelter for three months, which could be extended upon the victim's request; the government-run shelters accommodated two victims identified in 2017. The government-run shelters staffed a nurse, social worker, lawyer, and psychologist and offered separate sections for men, women, and children. Shelter staff chaperoned victims when leaving the shelter but victims could request to leave the shelter unchaperoned. In addition to equal services for domestic and foreign victims, the government reported foreign trafficking victims were eligible for renewable one-year residence permits with the ability to seek legal employment. The law prohibited penalizing trafficking victims for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being subjected to human trafficking; the government reported no such penalization in 2017. The government provided repatriation assistance to Georgian victims returning to Georgia and foreign victims wishing to leave Georgia; three victims received repatriation assistance to return to their home countries in 2017. The government reported encouraging victims to assist law enforcement with investigations and prosecutions, although their assistance was not required to receive government support; eight victims assisted law enforcement (three in 2016). The Prosecutor General's Office's Victim-Witness Coordinators provided counsel to victims from the beginning of the investigation through the end of the court proceedings. Observers reported prosecutors and judges applied victim-centered approaches to prevent re-traumatization during trial. The law allowed recorded testimony or testimony by other technological means; the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) reported none of the trials required such measures in 2017. Victims could pursue financial restitution through civil suits but no trafficking victims have ever received restitution from their traffickers. Observers highlighted the failure to freeze and seize criminal assets as an obstacle to pursuing restitution from traffickers. ","recommendation":"Improve efforts to proactively identify trafficking victims, particularly street children and Georgian and foreign victims in vulnerable labor sectors; further incorporate the labor inspectorate in anti-trafficking efforts with a clear mandate that establishes roles and responsibilities and enables unannounced inspections of employers; vigorously investigate, prosecute, and convict traffickers under article 143; increase law enforcement capacity to investigate complex cases, including advanced training for money laundering, organized crime, and digital evidence; improve measures to guarantee victims' access to compensation, including asset seizure, informing victims of their rights to compensation, and legal assistance; increase transparency of the inter-ministerial trafficking coordination council and provide public assessments; fully implement the law that provides street children with free government identification; create interagency strategies for reducing vulnerability and countering forced begging; and target awareness-raising campaigns about the existence of human trafficking, legal recourse, and available protection services to vulnerable groups.","tier":"TIER 1","traffick_profile":"As reported over the past five years, Georgia is a source, transit, and destination country for women and girls subjected to 196GERMANYsex trafficking and men, women, and children subjected to forced labor. Traffickers recruit victims with false promises of well-paying jobs in tea processing plants, hospitals, salons, restaurants, and hotels. The majority of identified trafficking victims are young, foreign women seeking employment. Women and girls from Georgia are subjected to sex trafficking within the country, in Turkey, and, to a lesser extent, in China and the United Arab Emirates. Georgia is also a transit country for women from Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan exploited in Turkey. Women from Azerbaijan and Central Asia are subjected to forced prostitution in the tourist areas of the Adjara region and larger cities like Tbilisi and Batumi in saunas, brothels, bars, strip clubs, casinos, and hotels. Georgian men and women are subjected to forced labor within Georgia and in Turkey, United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Cyprus, and Iraq. Georgian, Romani, and Kurdish children are subjected to forced begging and coerced into criminality in Georgia. No information was available about the presence of human trafficking in the separatist regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia; however, the government and NGOs consider internally displaced persons from these occupied territories particularly vulnerable to trafficking."},"Ghana":{"April":1.0,"Asylum Seekers":"18","August":1.0,"December":7.0,"February":1.0,"Friday":7.0,"Global Population":29767.1,"January":1.0,"July":2.0,"June":0.0,"Life Expectancy":63.78,"March":0.0,"May":0.0,"Monday":1.0,"November":0.0,"October":2.0,"Population below $1.90 a day":"13.3","Saturday":1.0,"September":5.0,"Sunday":3.0,"Thursday":2.0,"Tuesday":1.0,"Violence against civilians":20,"Wednesday":5.0,"fatalities":["1","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","2","0","0","0","1","1","0","0","7","0","1","3"],"government_effort":"NA","introduction":"The Government of Ghana does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. The government demonstrated increasing efforts compared to the previous reporting period; therefore Ghana was upgraded to Tier 2. The government demonstrated increasing efforts by validating and implementing the national anti-trafficking action plan and expending funds allocated for the plan; prosecuting and convicting labor and sex traffickers under the Human Trafficking Act; increasing interagency cooperation in efforts to remove child victims from trafficking situations; adopting systematic procedures for identifying and referring trafficking victims for services; and conducting and providing support for anti-trafficking public awareness activities. However, the government did not meet the minimum standards in several key areas. The government did not adequately address corruption and political interference in trafficking investigations and prosecutions or convene the inter-ministerial board responsible for anti-trafficking policy and administration of the human trafficking fund. The lack of sufficient resources for effective investigation and evidence collection and the shortage of state attorneys hindered prosecutions, and the courts failed to hold some convicted traffickers accountable with sentences strong enough to deter the crime. The limited availability of shelter spaces for children and the absence of any shelter for adult victims severely hampered the government's ability to protect and provide services to identified victims and impeded some officials from taking action to remove potential victims from trafficking situations.

At least three people have been shot dead with about seven others injured at Bimbilla in the Nanumba North District of the Northern Region by some unknown gunmen. The attack has been linked to the protracted chieftaincy dispute in the area.","prevention":"The government increased anti-trafficking prevention efforts. With input from stakeholders and support from an international organization as well as its own resources, the government finalized, validated, and began implementation of its National Plan of Action for the Elimination of Human Trafficking in Ghana, 2017-2021 (NPA), which includes activities under four objectives aligned with the \ufb014P\ufb02 paradigm of prosecution, protection, prevention, and partnership. Of the approximately 1.5 million cedis ($331,860) allocated for implementation of the plan in 2017, the government released 730,000 cedis ($161,500) in 2017, and expended 150,000 cedis ($33,190) to disseminate the NPA and support numerous human trafficking public awareness activities at the national, regional, district, and community levels. The government deposited 500,000 cedis ($110,620) into the human trafficking fund. Expenditure of these funds awaited inauguration of the Human Trafficking Management Board (HTMB), the inter-ministerial committee mandated to meet at least quarterly, administer the fund, advise the MOGCSP on anti-trafficking policy, promote prevention efforts, and facilitate the protection and reintegration of trafficking victims. The HTMB, dissolved in January due to the change in government, did not meet in 2017. The Human Trafficking Secretariat lacked sufficient personnel and government funds to fulfill its mandate to conduct monitoring and evaluation, data collection, and research related to trafficking. With donor support, government representatives of the Human Trafficking Secretariat, GPS, GIS, DSW, and state attorneys worked collaboratively with an international organization to develop systematic data collection methods to compile and report governmental anti-trafficking activities; however, the new methods were not implemented. The local government authorities in 32 communities in three regions partnered with an NGO to conduct community-level training on child trafficking prevention and identification and appropriate care for child trafficking victims. In response to continued reports of sex and labor trafficking, as well as serious physical abuse of Ghanaian women recruited for domestic work and hospitality jobs in the Middle East, in June the Minister of Employment and Labor Relations banned the issuance of work permits for jobs in the Middle East, and subsequently formed a cabinet-level committee with MFARI, 201GREECEMinistry of the Interior, and MOGCSP to examine recruitment processes. Since the ban, the GIS, which was responsible for examining exit permits issued by the Labor Department before a Ghanaian worker departed the country for foreign employment, reported an increase in Ghanaian workers' use of land borders to access airports outside of Ghana in order to fty to the Middle East. With foreign donor support, the government collaborated with an international organization to train recruitment agencies to identify emigrants vulnerable to trafficking and conduct a session on safe migration in the Brong Ahafo region. The government negotiated a bilateral agreement with the Government of Qatar that is under review by the AG. The government did not report on its efforts to implement the labor recruitment agreement signed with Jordan in 2016. Ghana also signed a cooperation agreement with other West African countries on the fight against child trafficking and the worst forms of child labor in the cocoa sector. The government made no efforts to decrease the demand for forced labor or for commercial sex acts. The government relied on foreign donors to provide anti-trafficking training to Ghanaian troops prior to their deployment abroad on peacekeeping missions. The government did not report providing anti-trafficking training for its diplomatic personnel.","prosecution":"The government increased its anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts. The 2005 Human Trafficking Act, amended in 2009, criminalized sex and labor trafficking. The Human Trafficking Act prescribed penalties of a minimum of five years imprisonment, which were sufficiently stringent and, with respect to sex trafficking, commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. However, the 2015 regulations for this Act provide specific guidance on sentencing depending on the circumstances; in general the term is not less than five years and not more than 25 years, but if a parent, guardian or other person with parental responsibilities facilitates or engages in trafficking, they are liable to a fine, a term of imprisonment of not less than five years and not more than 10 years, or both. By allowing for a fine in lieu of imprisonment, these prescribed punishments are not commensurate with those for other serious crimes, such as rape.The government reported initiating 113 total investigations into suspected human trafficking during calendar year 2017, compared to 138 investigations in 2016. Of the 113, the Ghana Police Service (GPS) Anti-Human Trafficking Unit (AHTU) reported conducting 91 investigations of potential trafficking crimes, compared with 118 investigations in 2016. Of these 74 were labor trafficking investigations, most of which were trafficking within Ghana, and 17 were sex trafficking investigations, all of which involved cross border trafficking. The Ghana Immigration Service (GIS) reported investigating 22 suspected trafficking cases compared with 20 cases in 2016; of these, 18 were labor trafficking cases and four were sex trafficking. The government reported investigating five recruitment agents for suspected human trafficking during the reporting period, compared to three in 2016. As in past years, the government did not prosecute or convict any recruitment agents for fraudulent offers of employment andor excessive fees for migration or job placement in 2017. The government reported initiating 29 prosecutions against 56 alleged traffickers, compared to 11 prosecutions involving 11 defendants in 2016. The government prosecuted 46 defendants for alleged labor trafficking and 10 defendants for alleged sex trafficking. The government prosecutions included 26 by the GPS involving 52 defendants, compared to eight GPS prosecutions in 2016. The GIS initiated prosecutions against three suspected traffickers, one allegedly involved in child labor trafficking and two allegedly involved in sex trafficking, under the Immigration Act due to insufficient evidence to proceed with trafficking charges, compared to three defendants prosecuted by the GIS in the prior year. The GIS also continued prosecuting one alleged labor trafficker charged in 2016. The government reported a state attorney initiated prosecution of one alleged trafficker in high court and a state attorney continued a 2014-initiated prosecution of an Egyptian national and a Ghanaian conspirator for suspected illegal labor recruitment and human trafficking. The GPS also transferred three suspected traffickers to Nigerian authorities after the court case was delayed due to the judge's illness and the lack of shelter. The government did not provide information on prosecutions initiated in prior years, which were stalled reportedly due to a lack of evidence, reluctance of victims to testify, or inability to locate the defendant. In 2017, the government convicted six traffickers, all of them prosecuted by the GPS under the anti-trafficking act; this compares to zero convictions under the anti-trafficking act and seven convictions for suspected trafficking offenses under other statutes that resulted in lesser penalties in 2016. The GIS convicted three individuals for immigration violations such as possessing false documents and deceiving public officials; these cases which were initially reported as suspected labor trafficking and sex trafficking crimes. Sentences imposed for the trafficking act convictions varied by the court hearing the case and ranged from six months imprisonment with a fine and victim restitution to five years imprisonment. A circuit court sentenced two traffickers convicted of forced labor to imprisonment of five years; a district court sentenced two traffickers convicted of forced labor to imprisonment of one year; and a circuit court sentenced two traffickers convicted of sex trafficking to six months imprisonment and payment of 10,000 cedis ($2,210) in restitution to the victims and a fine of 3,600 cedis ($800) or, if in default, a sentence of three years imprisonment. The district courts sentenced three individuals convicted of immigration act violations to fines of 600 to 1,200 cedis ($130 to $270). The government did not report any investigations, prosecutions, or convictions of government officials complicit in human trafficking offenses; however, officials acknowledged, and NGOs and other organizations continued to report, general corruption within the police and judicial system as well as political interference with police investigations and prosecutions of suspected human trafficking as ongoing concerns.Throughout the year, the GPS and GIS personnel reported a lack of adequate facilities, operating funds for logistics and investigative equipment, as well as appropriate shelter facilities for identified victims, which hampered or delayed investigative operations to remove potential victims from exploitative situations. State attorneys declined to prosecute several suspected trafficking cases due to inadequate evidence collection by police. While the Attorney General's (AG) Department continued to report a shortage of prosecutors, police prosecutors, who lack formal legal training and whose actions in cases are limited by procedural rules not applicable to state attorneys, initiated all but one of the trafficking prosecutions. The government supported introductory anti-trafficking training for 313 GIS recruits and 54 cadets, as well as a refresher course for 107 officers at the GIS training school; and provided in-kind support for numerous donor-funded training programs for hundreds of investigators, prosecutors, judges, social service personnel, labor officers, and journalists during the reporting period. ","protection":"The government increased efforts to identify and assist victims. The government reported identifying 579 potential victims of trafficking compared to 163 potential victims identified during the previous year. The GPS reported identifying 339 potential victims compared with 121 potential victims in 2016. Of these, 310 were potential victims of labor trafficking, most of whom were boys and many of whom were intercepted while being transported in groups within Ghana; 29 females were identified in suspected sex trafficking cases, nearly all of whom were adults. The GIS identified 215 females as potential trafficking victims compared with 42 in 2016. Of these, 203 were potential victims of labor trafficking and 12 were potential 200GHANAvictims of sex trafficking; nearly all of these potential victims were adults and many were intercepted while in transit to overseas employment. The Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection (MOGCSP) and the Department of Social Welfare (DSW) reported identifying 25 potential victims of labor trafficking, nearly all of whom were boys. Of the victims identified by the GPS and GIS, 32 were foreign national victims of labor or sex trafficking in Ghana, including 23 Nigerian sex trafficking victims. Ghanaian law enforcement collaborated with Nigerians residing in Ghana and the Nigerian foreign ministry and anti-trafficking authorities on the repatriation of the Nigerian citizens. In addition, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Regional Integration (MFARI), MOGCSP, GIS, and GPS cooperated in facilitating the repatriation of approximately 35 Ghanaian trafficking victims identified abroad, primarily in Middle East, by liaising with the victims' families, international organizations, and the government in the destination countries. Private citizens and international organizations continued to take primary responsibility for funding the return of Ghanaians exploited in trafficking situations abroad. The government reported providing counseling and referring 560 of the 579 potential victims of trafficking for care during the reporting period; however, the government did not provide details about the care for most victims. With the combined support of the Human Trafficking Secretariat and GPS totaling 13,200 cedis ($2,920), DSW provided short-term care for 31 child victims of trafficking in a shelter for abused children in Osu, where they received psycho-social and educational services. This shelter lacks security and is co-located with a girls correctional facility and a juvenile pre-trial detention facility with no structural barrier protecting the victims from criminal offenders. The government also provided a total of 22,600 cedis ($5,000) to three NGOs to support shelter and care for 95 child victims of trafficking and two adult female victims and their children. GIS provided 97,930 cedis ($21,670) to support the protection of adult victims. The government also reported it allocated 22,200 cedis ($4,910) to a children's shelter operation fund and 30,000 cedis ($6,640) for future operation of a shelter for adults that was under renovation in 2017. The government continued to rely on private facilities operated by NGOs and faith-based organizations to provide the care and treatment for most child trafficking victims in Ghana, for which it did not provide support. Working in cooperation with an international organization, the government contributed to the renovation of the only government shelter previously dedicated for child trafficking victims, but the facility remained closed due to incomplete renovations and pending approval of a memorandum of understanding between the MOGCSP and the donor organization outlining the government's support for the shelter's operations. Nonetheless, the overall shelter capacity for child labor trafficking victims was limited and most shelters did not provide services for child sex trafficking victims, which hampered efforts to remove potential child trafficking victims from exploitative situations. The absence of any shelter for adult victims of trafficking severely hampered the government's ability to provide services to adults. For immediate protection in some cases the government supported ad hoc shelter in safe houses for adult female victims and in two cases provided shelter for two female victims and their children in a shelter for children; no services were provided for adult male victims of trafficking. The MOGCSP established a toll free hotline in mid-December to facilitate access to social welfare programs, including services for human trafficking victims; it reported receiving 30 calls, one of which was referred to the GPS AHTU. NGOs reported improved cooperation with national, regional, and local government officials in response to NGO reports of suspected child trafficking and during law enforcement-led operations that were coordinated with the navy, marine police, and local social welfare workers, who were responsible for screening victims, securing care orders through the district courts, and arranging placement for child victims. The government collaborated with an international organization and NGOs to finalize and begin implementation of SOPs for screening, identifying, and referring victims during the reporting period. Ghanaian law permits victims of trafficking to pursue restitution by filing a civil suit. The government did not report any such suits or whether the traffickers ordered to pay restitution to two victims complied with the order. Foreign victims may seek temporary residency during the investigation and prosecution of their cases and, with the interior minister's approval, permanent residency if deemed to be in the victim's best interest; no victims sought temporary or permanent residency during the year. There were no reports that officials fined, detained, or penalized trafficking victims for unlawful acts committed as a result of being subjected to trafficking; due to the lack of full implementation of formal victim identification procedures, however, some victims may have remained unidentified in the law enforcement system. ","recommendation":"Provide increased resources to enable police and immigration service investigators, in cooperation with social welfare workers, to respond in a timely way to reports of suspected sex or labor trafficking, gather and preserve evidence effectively, and protect potential victims; increase efforts to address corruption and other interference that impede the investigation and prosecution of trafficking crimes; provide increased resources to support comprehensive trauma-informed care and reintegration services for adult and child trafficking victims in government-operated shelters; develop and provide specialized services for child and adult victims of sex trafficking; increase efforts to ensure attorney general prosecutors review human trafficking case dockets with investigators and lead the prosecution of human trafficking cases; hold traffickers accountable through prosecution and conviction under the anti-trafficking act and sentencing that is strong enough to deter others from committing these crimes; amend the 2015 implementing regulations for the 2005 Ghana Anti-Trafficking Act to remove the option of a fine in lieu of imprisonment in cases where the trafficker is a parent or guardian of the child victim; implement standard operating procedures (SOPs) for law enforcement, social welfare personnel, and labor inspectors throughout Ghana to proactively identify trafficking victims and refer them to protective services; increase efforts to identify and assist Ghanaian migrant workers who are in trafficking situations 199GHANAin other countries and investigate and prosecute recruitment agents and others suspected of participating in their trafficking; continue to implement the national plan of action against trafficking with dedicated resources, including administration of the human trafficking fund to expand victim services; provide advanced training to law enforcement on evidence collection in trafficking cases and to prosecutors and judges on pursuing cases under the anti-trafficking act; and implement systematic nationwide collection and reporting of data on investigations, prosecutions, victims identified by enforcement and protection agencies, and assistance provided.","tier":"TIER 2","traffick_profile":"As reported over the past five years, Ghana is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking. Ghanaian boys and girls are subjected to forced labor within the country in fishing, domestic service, street hawking, begging, portering, artisanal gold mining, quarrying, herding, and agriculture, including cocoa. Donor-funded research focused on the fishing industry on Lake Volta indicated that more than half of the children working on and around the lake were born in other communities and many of these children are subjected to forced labor; not allowed to attend school; given inadequate housing and clothing; and are controlled by fishermen through intimidation, violence, and limiting access to food. Boys as young as five years old are forced to work in hazardous conditions, including deep diving, and many suffer waterborne infections; girls perform work on shore such as cooking, cleaning fish, and preparing fish for market, and are vulnerable to sexual abuse. A study of the prevalence of child trafficking in selected communities in the Volta and Central Regions indicated that children from nearly one-third of the 1,621 households surveyed had been subjected to trafficking, primarily in fishing and domestic servitude. Child trafficking in the fishing industry is often facilitated by parents who receive a payment and organized traffickers who target vulnerable communities; girls exploited in domestic servitude are often sent via relatives or middlemen to work in harsh conditions. Boys aged 13-16 years who finished primary school in northern areas of Ghana are vulnerable to forced labor in agriculture, including in cocoa-growing areas; their transit is often facilitated by middlemen or relatives. Children living in northern regions sent by their parents to work in the south during the dry season are vulnerable to forced labor in agriculture and other sectors. Ghanaian girls, and to a lesser extent boys, are subjected to sex trafficking in urban areas across Ghana. Though reports are declining, some Ghanaian girls are subjected to forced servitude as part of a ritual to atone for sins of a family member. Ghanaian girls and young women from the rural northern regions move to urban centers throughout Ghana to seek work as porters; they are at risk for sex trafficking and forced labor. Ghanaian women and children are recruited and sent to the Middle East, West Africa, and Europe for forced labor and sex trafficking. Unscrupulous agencies arrange transport of Ghanaians seeking employment in Europe through neighboring African countries, where they are subjected to sexual exploitation and held involuntarily by traffickers who extort funds from the victims. Recruiters entice Ghanaian women and girls with offers of good paying jobs in domestic service or the hospitality industry in countries in the Middle East and attempt to circumvent the ban on recruitment for such jobs by arranging travel across land borders to access airports for ftights to the region. After their return, many of them report being deceived, overworked, starved, abused, molested, andor forced into prostitution. Ghanaian men are also recruited under false pretenses to go to the Middle East, where they are subjected to forced labor and forced prostitution. In recent years, a few Ghanaian men and women were identified as victims of forced labor in the United States. Nigerian women and girls who are lured to Ghana by the promise of a good job are coerced into prostitution to pay exorbitant debts for transportation and lodging. Some Ghanaian and Nigerian labor migrants are coerced into prostitution by traffickers who demand more money for transit and document costs. Children from West African countries are subjected to forced labor in Ghana in agriculture or domestic service. Ghana is a transit point for West Africans subjected to sex trafficking in Europe, especially Italy and Germany.

The suspect had already received payment for transferring the migrants from Evros at the Greek border with Turkey to the village of Exochi in Thessaloniki, where he forced them in an abandoned building and asked for 3,000 euros from each migrant. On Dec. 14 2018, after the Prime Minister's speech in Thessaloniki, a group of four people assaulted a 29-year-old man carrying a Greek flag kicking and beating him in a central street of Thessaloniki when the victim was about to enter his parked car. The young man had previously attended the Prime Minister's speech with other members of Christian Orthodox groups. On Dec. 8 2018, a 29-year-old Greek man was caught on a supermarket surveillance camera attacking with a crowbar a Bangladeshi supermarket employee at the parking lot of his workplace in the outskirts of Mytilene in the island of Lesvos (Lesbos) when the latter asked him not to park in the disabled space. The victim suffered a serious arm fracture. The attacker was arrested and set free under restrictive conditions of release. On Nov.26, 2018, a former Golden Dawn election representative shot and killed an Albanian land worker in Lefkimmi, South Corfu. The attacker was confirmed to have a swastika tattoo and that he disagreed publicly with the victim about the recent events in South Albania. Police arrested the shooter. The Golden Dawn MP for Corfu claimed that the perpetrator is not an active member of Golden Dawn. On Nov. 13, 2018: Four refugees were stopped by police near a gas station in Didymoteicho and placed in a dark car without seats. Masked men took them to the Turkey border on the next evening and hit them with batons. The masked attackers also shouted \"Fuck Islam\" and robbed the refugees before releasing them to go back to Turkey. On Nov. 10, 2018: A 25-year-old Moroccan refugee was caught in Greece near the Turkey border and Greek police handed him over to masked men wearing police uniforms. The man ordered him to take off his clothes and shoes and kicked him to the ground and hit him with a baton, then one of them subjected him to a mock execution. The man was then returned to Turkey. On Nov. 1, 2018: A woman from the Thebes migrant camp was attacked by four other male migrants who attempted to burn her alive. She was hospitalized with severe injuries, while the four attackers suffered knife wounds. The causes of the fight remained unknown. On Oct. 10, 2018: Three women were found dead near the River Evros, major crossing point for refugees and migrants, trying to get into the EU. Investigation is underway, but Greek media has reported they may have been killed as a punishment by migrant traffickers. On Sept. 23, 2018: Lawmaker from the governing SYRIZA party Petros Konstantineas was hospitalized overnight with non-life-threatening injuries, after a group of 30 people beat him outside a soccer stadium in the town of Kalamata. Greek police arrested eight people on suspicion of involvement in a mob attack by alleged far-rightists. On Sept. 7, 2018: Two migrant teenagers were returning to the Arsis shelter in Oraiokastro, when they were ambushed by a group of 8-10 hooded men, who demanded to know where the boys were from. They attacked the boys when they replied that they were from Pakistan. One of teenagers ran away, but the other was reportedly beaten with a bat and taken to hospital where he received several stitches. On Aug. 12, 2018: Greek fishermen reported that they were fired upon by Turkish fishing boats near Kalapodi islet, 300 meters off the coast of Leros island, Phthiotis. The seaman said that the Turkish boats were inside Greece's territorial waters when their crews shot at them. Early August, 2018: A group of refugees, at least one of which was Tunisian, were detained by Greek police near Orestaida and were taken to a building resembling a military base nearby. Guards of the building violently pushed them against a wall, searched them, and hit them. One of the men used a stun gun on the Tunisian refugee and burned his back. The refugees were detained for one day before they were sent back to turkey. On July 16, 2018: In Santorini, unidentified assailants attacked an official of the town planning authority, inflicting facial injuries. According to the mayor of Santorini, the attack was linked to an application for construction in the area. On 13 July, an elderly farmer from Lesbos shot and injured a Syrian refugee teenager on his estate near the Moria camp. The farmer, who was later sentenced to 13 years in prison, claimed he intended to fire warning shots close to the teenager, who was hospitalised with head and leg injuries. On June 23 2018, four men assaulted a Pakistani minor in a central park of Thessaloniki on the evening of the day of the Thessaloniki Pride rally and march. The assailants asked him if he was taking part in the Pride event and what his sexual preferences were. The men aged between 16 and 22 have been arrested and they are also investigated in connection to another assault earlier in the day during the Pride march. Two participants - one Greek and another either Italian or Brazilian - were assaulted by four men who verbally abused them before throwing them into the sea. The two men were not injured. On June 15 2018, two assailants assaulted two Pakistani immigrants and a third immigrant of unknown nationality in the east Attica suburb of Acharnes in a pair of attacks. The assailants stole a mobile phone and cash and beat the immigrants while berating them with racist comments. One suspected extreme nationalist was arrested and police are seeking a second suspect. They will face charges of breaching anti-racism laws. As reported on May 29 2018 , 22 migrants had been held hostage in a complex of abandoned buildings in the Thessaloniki suburb of Oreokastro and were forced to demand money from their families. Greek police rescued them on May 29. Three foreign nationals, aged 19, 20 and 25, were arrested on suspicion of kidnapping and blackmail, among other charges. On May 19 2018, the Mayor of Thessaloniki was beaten by a nationalist mob - some of whom were wearing hoods - caught on camera during a ceremony for the commemoration of the Pontic Genocide. 12 people kicked and punched him and threw objects at the mayor, who was rushed to the hospital. The European Commission spokesman, Israel's embassy, the Prime Minister and the country's political parties with the exception of Golden Dawn, condemned the incident. In the following days, all 12 suspects were identified and three were arrested and convicted. The Mayor known for his strong anti-nationalist stance said he was attacked by fascists and that he will not be intimidated. On May 16 2018, in Athens, five teenagers violently attacked a Pakistani man knocking him to the ground before starting to kick and punch him to the head. The victim said his attackers' motives were racist. Police is examining video footage to identify the culprits. As reported on May 09 2018, 50 migrants were kidnapped and had been held hostage in abandoned buildings east of Thessaloniki six days earlier, although some were more recent arrivals. They were forced to demand money from their families. There were 38 Pakistanis, 10 Bangladeshis and two Sri Lankans, who were in bad physical condition, having been given minimal food and water. One man required hospitalisation for pneumonia and dehydration. Two Pakistani men were arrested for kidnapping and blackmail among other charges. Greek police rescued them on May 9. Late April, 2018: Seven refugees, crossing the Evros River were kidnapped by masked men upon their arrival on the Greek side. They were put in a van from which they could not see the road, returned to the river, robbed, and shipped back to Turkey with a rubber boat. On Feb. 26, 2018: Two men believed to be migrants were killed in a fight have been found in an abandoned building outside the town of Alexandroupolis. Autopsies and a search of the area indicated the two died of multiple wounds caused by knives, bottles and being hit by chairs during a fight.","prevention":"The government increased efforts to prevent trafficking. The Office of the National Rapporteur on Human Trafficking (ONRHT) continued to coordinate government wide anti-trafficking efforts despite lacking sufficient resources. The government monitored anti-trafficking efforts but did not have a national action plan and did not make assessments publicly available. ONRHT continued the development of a national database for trafficking statistics. ONRHT organized and funded its third national two-day anti-trafficking awareness festival and signed a memorandum of cooperation with a network of businesses to promote forced labor free supply chains through awareness raising activities. The government held awareness raising events for public transportation staff and passengers and provided airtime for free public service announcements for NGOs and government agencies on trafficking issues. In March 2017, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Greece failed to protect 42 Bangladeshi victims on a strawberry farm near the town of Manolada in a forced labor case in 2013. The court ordered Greece to pay each of the applicants who had participated in the proceedings between \u202216,360 and \u202220,360 ($19,640 and $24,440). The government continued efforts to reduce the demand for commercial sex and forced labor. ","prosecution":"The government increased law enforcement efforts. Article 323A and article 351 of the criminal code criminalized sex and labor trafficking and prescribed penalties of up to 10 years imprisonment and a fine between \u202210,000 ($12,000) to \u202250,000 ($60,020). These penalties were sufficiently stringent and, with regard to sex trafficking, commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. Police investigated 21 cases with 147 suspects (25 cases with 97 suspects in 2016), 20 cases of sex trafficking and one case of forced labor (18 sex trafficking cases and seven forced labor cases in 2016). The government prosecuted 26 defendants (32 defendants in 2016), 21 defendants for sex trafficking and five defendants for forced labor (25 for sex trafficking and seven for forced labor in 2016). Courts convicted 37 traffickers in 26 cases (11 traffickers in eight cases in 2016), 35 for sex trafficking and two for forced labor (10 for sex trafficking and one for forced labor in 2016). Of the 33 convictions for which the government provided sentencing data, 31 received prison sentences of more than 18 months. Eleven sex traffickers received prison sentences between 18 months and nine years with fines ranging between \u20221,000 ($1,200) to \u202250,000 ($60,020). Nineteen sex traffickers received prison sentences between 10 years and 20 years with fines ranging between \u202225,000 ($30,010) and \u202271,300 ($85,590). One labor trafficker received four months imprisonment and another received 10 years with a fine of \u202250,000 ($60,020). The government sentenced one trafficker to community-based rehabilitation and could not provide sentencing data for four traffickers. Courts also issued six convictions at the second instance (one in 2016); sentences ranged from three years and a small fine to six years and \u202210,000 ($12,000).The Hellenic Police Unit maintained an Anti-Trafficking Unit (ATU) within the Organized Crime Division composed of two units with 37 officers in Athens and 10 officers in Thessaloniki that investigated trafficking and vice crimes and 12 smaller units across municipalities that investigated trafficking and organized crime. ATU officers conducted joint inspections with labor inspectors on 206 companies and regularly inspected brothels, bars, and massage parlors. However, observers reported the 12 smaller units often consisted of one appointed officer to handle trafficking cases among many other duties and lacked the resources and staff to conduct proactive investigations. NGOs continued to report good cooperation with law enforcement and excellent cooperation with ATU. The government maintained two specialized public prosecutors in Athens; one attached to the first instance court and the other to the appeals court. The government trained front-line officers on trafficking issues, but observers reported non-specialized law enforcement and government officials, particularly in rural areas, lacked an understanding of trafficking. The government did not report any investigations, prosecutions, or convictions of government employees complicit in trafficking; still, corruption and official complicity in trafficking crimes remained concerns. Observers reported traffickers likely bribed state certified interpreters to alter the content of victim statements or inftuence their testimony. In 2016, the government prosecuted two police officers involved in an organized criminal group that sexually exploited women. The government extradited four suspected traffickers in 2017 (three to Switzerland in 2016) and prepared extradition for two individuals. The government shared information with 14 European countries on trafficking cases. ","protection":"The government maintained victim protection efforts. The government identified 38 victims (46 in 2016); 35 victims were subjected to sex trafficking and three to forced begging (26 to sex trafficking, nine to forced labor, and eleven to forced begging in 2016); 24 were adults and 14 were children (30 adults and 16 children in 2016); 34 were female and four male (30 females and 16 males in 2016); and four victims were Greek and 34 were foreign citizens (11 Greeks and 35 foreign citizens in 2016). Statistics included some, but not all, potential victims identified by non-law enforcement entities. First responders followed standard operating procedures for identifying victims. The government, separately and in cooperation with international organizations and NGOs, trained law enforcement, immigration officers, social service workers, labor inspectors, airport staff, and health workers on victim identification. The government reported increased identification efforts targeting migrants and asylum-seekers and slightly improved interagency coordination at migrant reception centers; authorities identified three potential victims in reception centers. However, observers continued to report some cases of inadequate or hasty screening procedures and vulnerability assessments at migrant entry points and camps. ATU and civil society conducted proactive identification efforts, but most government efforts were reactive and identification resulted only from victims self-identifying. GRETA reported a lack of identification efforts for victims of forced labor, particularly in the agriculture sector, cleaning and domestic service, and the tourism industry. Proactive identification among vulnerable unaccompanied children also remained inadequate, including for forced begging and forced criminality. The law mandated public prosecutors to officially recognize victims based on information collected by law enforcement, or a psychologist and a social worker if a victim did not want to cooperate with law enforcement; public prosecutors officially certified all 38 identified victims in 2017 (four in 2016). Official victim status entitled foreign victims to a renewable one-year residence and work permit, but potential victims without this status had access to equal support and assistance; public prosecutors officially certified 38 victims (four in 2016). Observers reported the government did not consistently use psychologists and social workers for identification procedures and procedures often took six to 12 months for victims to receive official status. Observers also reported the government did not recognize potential victims who were exploited abroad but identified in Greece, creating obstacles in accessing support entitled by law. The government maintained a national referral mechanism and, in 2017, created and disseminated a manual for identification procedures and standard referral forms. The government also held regular working group meetings to further define roles and responsibilities among law enforcement, government agencies, and NGOs; the labor inspectorate appointed five staff members to participate in the working groups. NGO-run support services reported improved cooperation and increased referrals from law enforcement, but some police officers remained reluctant to refer victims to NGO-run support services. The government, 203GUATEMALAin cooperation with NGOs, provided shelter, psycho-social support, medical care, legal aid, and reintegration support. The government was unable to determine how much funding was spent on victim protection and did not allocate funding to civil society. The government maintained a cooperation agreement with three NGOs to house, protect, and assist vulnerable women and children, including trafficking victims, and allocated three buildings to use as shelters. Observers reported a lack of specialized shelters for trafficking victims; only one NGO-run shelter provided shelter specifically for female trafficking victims. The government provided shelter and general support services to trafficking victims through two agencies: the General Secretariat for Gender Equality operated 19 shelters and 40 counseling centers for female victims of violence and the National Social Solidarity Center operated two long-term shelters, an emergency shelter, and two Social Support Centers for vulnerable populations in need of assistance. Victims in rural areas had little access to support services and were often accommodated in police stations, hospital wards, or received no assistance. Male victims could be accommodated in an NGO-run shelter for sexually exploited men or short-term government shelters for asylum-seekers or homeless persons. Government-run shelters, NGO-run shelters, and facilities for unaccompanied minors accommodated child victims but did not provide specialized support. Observers reported overcrowded facilities for child victims and GRETA reported authorities held unaccompanied children in police cells up to several months due to a lack of shelters. Victims who did not apply for official recognition could receive a residence and work permit by applying for asylum on humanitarian grounds; the government issued 15 residence permits (23 in 2016). Observers reported the process to receive residence permits took time, but the government granted victims a temporary document that prevented deportation or detainment. The government may have deported, detained, or restricted freedom of movement of some trafficking victims due to inadequate identification efforts. Experts reported a lack of victim-centered approaches, including cases of law enforcement conducting interviews described by victims as interrogations. There were also reports of authorities not adequately informing victims about court proceedings and lacking interpretation services for foreign victims. Court proceedings often lasted two to six years, which hindered cooperation from victims and key witnesses. The government did not provide funding for travel and other expenses for victims to attend court hearings and observers reported traffickers might have paid bribes to repatriated trafficking victims to preclude them from testifying. The law entitled victims to mental health professionals during court proceedings and the use of audiovisual technology for remote testimony, but many courts lacked the capabilities to deploy these resources and many judges continued to require victims to appear in front of their trafficker in court, causing re-traumatization. Observers reported judges lacked sensitivity and an understanding of the impact of psychological trauma on victims' ability to consistently and clearly relate the circumstances of their exploitation and inappropriately dismissed as unreliable victim testimony. The law provided for witness protection and non-disclosure of the witness' personal information; however, observers reported no trafficking victims had received full witness protection privileges to date and courts sometimes revealed victims' identities during proceedings. The law entitled victims to file civil suits against traffickers for compensation but no victims to date had received compensation or received restitution from their traffickers. The government reported trafficking victims had never applied for compensation. ","recommendation":"Increase proactive identification efforts for victims of forced labor and victims among vulnerable populations and refer them to specialized services; strengthen specialized services including shelter and psycho-social support for all victims, including children, adult males, and victims in rural areas; vigorously investigate, prosecute, and convict traffickers, including officials complicit in trafficking; decrease the length of court proceedings for trafficking cases; develop policies for victim-centered prosecutions and implement witness protection provisions already incorporated into law to encourage 202GREECEvictims' participation in investigations and prosecutions; take concrete steps to expedite the victim identification process and consistently include psychologists and social workers; provide training to judges, prosecutors, and law enforcement on trafficking investigations and prosecutions, particularly in rural areas and for non-specialized staff; train first responders on victim identification and the national referral mechanism; standardize data collection and produce accurate data on anti-trafficking efforts; consistently inform victims of their right to compensation; and draft a national action plan for combating trafficking.","tier":"TIER 2","traffick_profile":"As reported over the past five years, Greece is a destination, transit, and, to a limited extent, source country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking and men, women, and children subjected to forced labor. Some women and children from Eastern and Southern Europe, South Asia, Russia, Nigeria, and China are subjected to sex trafficking in unlicensed brothels, on the street, in strip clubs, in massage salons, and in hotels. Victims of forced labor in Greece are primarily children and men from Eastern Europe, South Asia, and Africa. Migrant workers from Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Afghanistan are susceptible to debt bondage, reportedly in agriculture. Economically marginalized Romani children from Albania, Bulgaria, and Romania are forced to sell goods on the street, beg, or commit petty theft in Greece. The increase in unaccompanied child migrants in Greece has increased the number of children susceptible to exploitation. Some public officials have been investigated for suspected involvement in human trafficking. Unaccompanied children, primarily from Afghanistan, engage in survival sex and are vulnerable to trafficking. Recruiters target migrants in refugee camps from their own countries. Most migrants and asylum-seekers are believed to rely on smugglers at some point during their journey and in some instances are forced into exploitation upon arrival in Greece.

Despite these achievements, the government did not provide sufficient funding to the Office for the Protection of Gender, Children, and Morals (OProGen), the police unit responsible for trafficking investigations, and did not allocate a budget to the anti-trafficking committee (CNLTPPA) for the second consecutive year, hindering prevention efforts. It did not report referring all identified trafficking victims to care. In addition, despite the prevalence of child forced begging in Quranic schools, Guinean authorities have never prosecuted a marabout\u0160a Quranic teacher\u0160for child forced begging.

A journalist accused of criticising Guinean executives is assaulted by an unidentified armed group in Bambeto. 17 December. A woman is abducted by an unidentified armed group and found dead two weeks later, on 2 January, at Bantighel near Pita. During the week of 3-9 Dec 2018, an armed man opened fire in a night club in Fello Kahi locality of Dara Kethioun, Dara-Labe, Labe as he allegedly wanted to discourage the operation of the club. The assailant was arrested by the police. On 5 Dec 2018, a young mechanic was beaten and kidnapped by men who could have been the police at Madina market in Conakry. The victim's brother was allegedly complicit in the kidnapping as the latter owed the victim money. On 26 Nov 2018, armed men burst into the home of the publishing director of Guinea Times and Africa Times in Taouyah area of Ratoma Commune, Conakry. Several members of the journalists' family were wounded. On Nov 8 and 9, mass police deployment in Wanindara in Conakry and retaliatory attacks against civilians. Several people were injured with gunshot wounds, some men and women were abused, and goods looted. On Nov 8 and 9, mass police deployment in Wanindara in Conakry and retaliatory attacks against civilians. Several people were injured with gunshot wounds, some men and women were abused, and goods looted. On Nov 7, soldiers killed two young men suspected of being part of the opposition in Conakry. The attack occurred on the margins of clashes between UFDG rioters and police in the context of a dead city day call in the capital. On Nov 4, an unknown armed man entered a nightclub in Labe and started shooting. There were some injuries. On Oct 23, as UFDG leader Cellou Dalein Diallo left his home in Conakry to join his supporters to protest the municipal elections, Diallo claimed that police fired tear gas and gunshot to prevent him from leaving, claiming an assassination attempt. Diallo's driver was injured. The police denied that they were the ones who fired the gunshot. In the week of 9 July, unidentified men killed a merchant in his boutique in Siguiri. Circumstances unclear. \"One male national UN contracted driver was ambushed near Yende in Kissidougou, and seriously injured by the unknown armed perpetrators.\" Month of June. Security forces attack civilians by firing live rounds at civilians, killing 2 and injuring 10 others. On 20 March, a woman received a gunshot wound from a policeman in Ratoma while preparing food in her home. Circumstances unclear. Dead city initiatives were ongoing. On 19 March, a UFDG politician was killed by unknown armed men in Sinta. A Saudi preacher was shot dead. The murderers have not been identified, but a security source suggests he had conducted a \"preach that was not in the taste\" of a part of the local population.","prevention":"The government maintained efforts to prevent trafficking. CNLTPPA continued to meet sporadically, but not all members consistently attended meetings, and the committee lacked coordination and communication. For the second year, the government did not finalize a decree that would allocate an operational budget to CNLTPPA, so it lacked funding to perform many of its planned activities. Despite these shortcomings, CNLTPPA enacted an emergency action plan to provide shelter and services to 26 trafficking victims and conduct awareness-raising campaigns. In partnership with the Ministry of Social Action and NGOs, CNLTPPA organized three sensitization campaigns targeting local communities along Guinea's borders with Sierra Leone and Senegal, common routes for traffickers bringing children to Senegal for forced begging. The lack of local-level coordination on anti-trafficking efforts and the lack of training for officials outside the capital continued to hinder progress. The government had policies to regulate foreign labor recruiters and hold them civilly and criminally liable for fraudulent recruitment, but neither OProGen nor the Ministry of Labor had the resources or the trained personnel to implement such policies consistently. The government did not make discernible efforts to reduce the demand for forced labor or commercial sex acts. The government did not provide anti-trafficking training to its diplomatic personnel. The government, in partnership with foreign donors, provided anti-trafficking training to Guinean troops prior to their deployment abroad as part of international peacekeeping missions. ","prosecution":"The government increased anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts. Article 323 of the penal code, as amended in 2016, criminalized labor and sex trafficking. Article 324 prescribed penalties of three to seven years imprisonment, a fine, or both for adult trafficking, and five to 10 years imprisonment, a fine, or both for child trafficking. These penalties were sufficiently stringent. By allowing for a fine in lieu of imprisonment, the penalties for sex trafficking were not commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. Article 344 of the penal code separately criminalized forced begging and prescribed penalties of one to three years imprisonment and a fine; these penalties were not sufficiently stringent. The government investigated 44 cases, prosecuted 18 suspects, and convicted 18 traffickers in four cases, a significant increase from five investigations, prosecuting four suspects, and convicting three traffickers the previous reporting period. OProGen had the lead for investigating trafficking cases, and the General Secretary for Special Services, Counter-Narcotics, and Combating Organized Crime could investigate transnational trafficking cases. Among the 44 investigations, the general secretary's office identified at least seven transnational trafficking networks, and law enforcement launched 18 investigations into pandering, including child sex trafficking. In one case, a judge convicted six individuals\u0160including an imam\u0160for fraudulently recruiting at least 18 women for forced prostitution in Kuwait. A second judge convicted eight bar owners for pandering of minors. Sentences among the 18 convicted traffickers ranged from four months suspended to five years imprisonment; 17 traffickers received non-suspended sentences, and eight traffickers received sentences of at least two years imprisonment. The government did not report if it continued investigations from the previous reporting period into an alleged recruiter who sent women to Egypt for domestic servitude or three marabouts for alleged child forced begging. Authorities reported police frequently intercepted convoys of children allegedly destined for forced begging, and while they removed the children, they did not investigate the alleged traffickers. Corruption among law enforcement and the judiciary\u0160suspected to be especially prominent among labor inspectors, customs directors, and heads of police stations\u0160allegedly impeded anti-trafficking efforts. The government reported one investigation into three airport officials who were allegedly complicit in sending Guinean women to Kuwait for forced prostitution; the investigation was ongoing at the close of the reporting period. The government did not report allocating any funding to OProGen to investigate trafficking cases and transport victims to NGOs for care, a significant decrease from the previous reporting period, when it had allocated 256 million Guinean francs ($28,430). Lack of general knowledge about trafficking and the trafficking provisions of the 2016 penal code persisted among government officials, especially judges and prosecutors in lower courts, but the government did not provide any training during the reporting period.","protection":"The government decreased efforts to identify, but modestly increased efforts to protect, trafficking victims. The government identified 10 trafficking victims and intercepted 16 children en route to exploitation, compared to identifying 107 children en route to exploitation in the previous reporting period. The government also reported identifying an unknown number of children in domestic servitude, although it did not report removing any of those children from their situations of exploitation. The government did not have formal procedures to identify trafficking victims or refer them to care, so victim identification and protection measures remained extremely weak. No government center or shelter could assist victims, so the government continued to rely on NGOs and foreign donors to finance and provide the majority of victim care. In a positive change from the previous reporting period, the government disbursed 50 million Guinean francs ($5,550) to an NGO to provide shelter, food, medical assistance, and psychological support to at least 26 trafficking victims; this NGO operated three shelters that cared for vulnerable children, including trafficking victims. The shelters cared for both foreign and domestic victims, although they did not provide trafficking-specific services. Law enforcement referred child trafficking victims to NGOs on an ad hoc basis. Some OProGen officials brought victims to their private homes until space became available in NGO shelters. Government health facilities and social workers could at times provide medical and psycho-207GUINEA-BISSAUsocial services. Officials acknowledged the lack of training for authorities on victim identification and referral affected victim care. With donor funding, the government provided shelter, food, psycho-social support, toiletries, and some money to vulnerable migrants returned from Libya, some of whom had been exploited in trafficking. The government did not encourage trafficking victims to participate in the investigations or prosecutions of their traffickers; in some cases, law enforcement interrogated victims during investigations. Reports indicated victims and their parents were reluctant to file claims against traffickers due to a lack of confidence in the judicial system. The 2016 penal code allowed NGOs to become plaintiffs on behalf of victims. Articles 392-396 of the child protection code provided child trafficking victims the right to legal representation and a ministry-appointed guardian, but due to the lack of financial and human resources, these services were not available during the reporting period. While victims could legally obtain restitution from the government and file civil suits against their traffickers, the government did not provide victims with sufficient knowledge of the process to enable them to do so. The government did not have formal policies to provide temporary or permanent residency to victims from countries where, if repatriated, they would face hardship or retribution, but it could provide work and residence permits to such victims on an ad hoc basis; the government did not report any victims requested these services during the reporting period. There were no reports the government detained, fined, or jailed victims for unlawful acts committed as a result of being subjected to trafficking; due to a lack of formal victim identification procedures, however, some trafficking victims may have remained unidentified in the law enforcement system.","recommendation":"Vigorously investigate, prosecute, and convict suspected traffickers, including complicit officials and some marabouts, and prescribe sufficiently stringent sentences; expand victim care by increasing financial or in-kind support to NGOs that provide victim services; increase funding for OProGen and the CNLTPPA to allow them to fulfill their mandates; train magistrates and prosecutors in the lower courts on the new trafficking articles in the 2016 penal codes; develop and train officials on systematic procedures to identify trafficking victims and refer them to services; regularly convene the CNLTPPA, and provide it sufficient resources; increase efforts to raise public awareness of trafficking, including of internal child forced labor, forced begging in Quranic schools, and adult trafficking; provide OProGen and labor inspectors the resources and training necessary to regulate recruitment agencies, and investigate cases of fraudulent recruitment; respect victims' rights during trafficking investigations; amend the penal code to remove sentencing provisions that allow fines in lieu of imprisonment and increase penalties prescribed for forced begging; designate a single point of contact within the Ministry of Justice to ensure all convicted traffickers serve their prescribed sentences; and enhance collaboration and information sharing among all government agencies involved in combating trafficking.","tier":"TIER 2 WATCH LIST","traffick_profile":"As reported over the past five years, Guinea is a source, transit, and\u0160to a lesser extent\u0160destination country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking. Women and children are the most vulnerable to trafficking. Parents send girls to intermediaries who subject them to domestic servitude and sex trafficking, sometimes in motels and restaurants in Conakry. Traffickers exploit boys in begging, street vending and shoe shining, forced labor in gold and diamond mines, and in herding, fishing, and agriculture, including farming and on coffee, cashew, and cocoa plantations. Some government entities and NGOs allege that within Guinea, forced labor is most prevalent in the mining sector. Traffickers subject men, women, and children to forced labor in agriculture. Reports indicate children are sent to the coastal region of Boke for forced labor on farms. Children from villages in Middle and Upper Guinea may be more vulnerable to trafficking due to the region's lack of schools and economic opportunities. Some traffickers take children with parents' consent under the false pretenses of providing an education and exploit them in forced begging in Quranic schools in Senegal\u0160via Koundara\u0160Mauritania, and Guinea-Bissau, or forced labor in West African gold mines. Some corrupt marabouts force Bissau-Guinean boys to beg in Guinean Quranic schools. Guinean children are exploited in forced labor in Cote d'Ivoire. Guinea is a transit country for West African children subjected to forced labor in gold mining throughout the region. A small number of girls from West African countries migrate to Guinea, where they are exploited in domestic service, street vending, and\u0160to a lesser extent\u0160sex trafficking. Guinean women and girls are victims of domestic servitude and sex trafficking in West Africa, Europe, and the Middle East, as well as the United States. Guinean-Egyptian trafficking networks fraudulently recruit women for domestic work in Egypt and exploit them in prostitution. During the reporting period, several airline companies with service to North and East Africa and the Middle East began to serve Conakry; authorities identified an increased number of trafficking networks fraudulently recruiting Guinean, Liberian, and Sierra Leonean women for work abroad, using the Conakry airport to transport victims to exploitative situations in Kuwait and Qatar. There have been reports some Guinean men marry Guinean girls, take them to Angola, and sell the girls to local brothels while the men work in diamond mines. In previous years, authorities have identified Guinean forced labor victims in Finland, Guinean boys exploited in commercial sex in the Netherlands, and Thai and Chinese women in forced prostitution in Guinea. During the reporting period, an international organization repatriated more than 3,756 Guineans from Libya and northern Mali, and the organization estimated more than 560 were victims of trafficking. The lack of data on trafficking in Guinea renders it difficult to assess the size and scope of the problem."},"India":{"April":62.0,"Asylum Seekers":"40","August":114.0,"December":137.0,"February":46.0,"Friday":146.0,"Global Population":1352642.28,"January":43.0,"July":61.0,"June":58.0,"Life Expectancy":69.42,"March":60.0,"May":84.0,"Monday":185.0,"November":108.0,"October":106.0,"Population below $1.90 a day":"21.2","Saturday":131.0,"September":112.0,"Sunday":153.0,"Thursday":108.0,"Tuesday":123.0,"Violence against civilians":991,"Wednesday":145.0,"fatalities":["0","1","1","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","2","0","0","1","0","0","1","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","1","0","0","0","2","0","0","1","0","1","0","0","0","0","1","1","0","1","0","2","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","1","1","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","1","1","0","0","3","0","0","1","1","0","1","0","0","0","0","1","0","1","0","0","1","1","1","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","2","0","0","1","0","1","1","0","1","1","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","1","1","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","1","1","1","1","0","0","0","0","1","0","1","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","4","1","1","1","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","1","1","0","0","1","1","0","1","1","1","0","1","0","0","1","1","1","1","0","0","1","1","1","1","0","1","0","1","1","1","2","5","0","0","1","0","1","1","1","0","0","0","0","1","0","1","1","1","0","0","0","0","1","0","1","0","1","0","1","0","1","1","0","0","0","1","1","0","1","1","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","1","1","2","1","2","0","0","0","2","0","0","1","0","1","1","0","1","1","1","1","1","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","1","1","0","0","2","1","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","1","0","1","1","0","0","1","1","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","0","1","1","1","2","2","0","2","1","0","1","0","2","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","1","0","0","1","1","1","1","1","0","0","1","2","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","1","0","1","1","1","1","0","0","1","1","0","1","1","0","0","0","1","1","0","0","2","0","0","0","0","1","1","1","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","1","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","1","2","1","1","1","0","1","0","0","0","1","1","2","0","1","0","1","1","1","1","1","0","1","1","1","1","4","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","1","0","0","0","1","1","0","3","1","0","0","1","0","0","1","1","0","0","0","1","1","1","0","1","1","1","0","1","0","1","1","0","1","1","1","0","0","0","0","1","0","1","0","0","1","0","1","0","0","1","0","1","1","1","0","1","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","1","0","1","1","1","1","1","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","1","1","1","1","0","1","1","1","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","1","0","0","1","0","0","1","1","0","0","0","0","1","1","0","3","1","0","0","2","1","0","1","1","1","0","1","0","1","1","1","1","0","1","1","0","1","1","1","1","1","1","0","0","0","0","1","1","0","0","0","0","0","3","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","1","0","0","1","1","0","0","0","1","0","1","0","0","0","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","0","1","1","2","1","0","1","1","1","1","2","0","1","1","0","2","0","0","1","0","1","1","0","2","0","1","1","1","1","0","0","1","2","1","1","1","1","2","1","1","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","1","0","0","0","1","0","0","1","1","1","1","2","0","1","0","0","1","1","1","1","1","1","0","2","2","1","1","1","1","1","0","0","0","0","2","3","3","0","0","0","1","0","1","1","1","0","0","0","0","1","1","1","1","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","2","0","0","1","1","0","0","0","0","1","1","1","2","0","0","0","1","1","0","1","1","1","0","0","0","1","1","1","0","1","1","0","0","0","2","0","0","1","2","1","1","0","1","0","1","1","2","2","1","1","1","1","0","1","0","0","1","2","1","1","0","0","0","3","1","2","2","1","1","0","1","0","0","1","1","2","0","0","1","1","0","0","0","1","1","1","0","0","1","1","0","1","1","3","2","1","0","0","1","0","1","0","0","0","1","1","0","0","0","1","1","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","1","1","1","1","0","0","1","0","0","1","1","1","0","0","1","1","1","0","1","0","1","0","1","0","0","1","1","0","0","0","0","0","3","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","1","1","0","0","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","0","0","0"],"government_effort":"NA","introduction":"The Government of India does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. The government demonstrated 222INDIAincreasing efforts compared to the previous reporting period; therefore India remained on Tier 2. The government demonstrated increasing efforts by nearly tripling the number of victims identified and increasing its budget for shelter programs for female and child trafficking victims. The government's inter-ministerial committee met during the reporting period to discuss and revise a draft anti-trafficking bill and India's border guard force on the India-Nepal border conducted several awareness activities on human trafficking for students and border communities. However, the government did not meet the minimum standards in several key areas. Overall victim protection remained inadequate and inconsistent, and the government sometimes penalized victims through arrests for crimes committed as a result of being subjected to human trafficking.

The government's inter-ministerial committee, chaired by the secretary of the MWCD and including civil society organizations and relevant government ministries, met during the reporting period to discuss and revise the draft anti-trafficking bill. The government did not have a national action plan to combat trafficking; however, it did have a national plan of action for children, launched in a previous reporting period, which outlined efforts to prevent and protect children from trafficking and to conduct research and analysis. In January 2018, the government reported help desks had been established in 33 major railway stations to provide immediate support to unaccompanied children, who may be missing, abandoned, or runaways and who may be vulnerable to exploitation, including trafficking. Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB), India's border guard force on the India-Nepal border, conducted several awareness activities on human trafficking 225INDIAfor students and border communities in September 2017. SSB hosted a workshop, organized a painting competition to raise awareness in 39 schools, and commissioned two vehicles to create an awareness caravan for border districts with speakers and awareness materials. Some state governments had state-level action plans, task forces, and MOUs to combat trafficking and conducted anti-trafficking awareness campaigns or made in-kind contributions to NGO-run campaigns. West Bengal police continued to implement regular awareness events with students, teachers, and administrators, including in four new districts in early 2018. The government registered foreign recruitment agencies and Indian migrant workers through the eMigrate online system. The government required migrant workers going to 17 specific countries, including the Middle East, to receive emigration clearance before their departure. Among other steps, clearance required Indian overseas missions to verify employment agreements for unskilled and farm workers and all female migrant workers. The government banned female migrant workers under age 30 from working in the 17 countries. The UN and members of civil society continued to argue any ban on migration increased the likelihood of migrating illegally and therefore heightened their vulnerability to human trafficking. MEA provided counseling and other resources to those considering migrant work at five resource centers in Chennai, Gurgaon, Hyderabad, Kochi, and Lucknow. In July 2017, India's Cabinet approved revised guidelines for the MEA's Indian Community Welfare Fund (ICWF) to expand the fund's geographic use from 43 Indian missions to all Indian missions abroad and the scope of services to include awareness measures and hotlines for migrant workers in distress, in addition to continuing the services of shelter, legal assistance, and repatriation. The ICWF was primarily funded through overseas consular fees. The government had MOUs on human trafficking with Bahrain, Bangladesh, and the United Arab Emirates, and in January 2018, India and Cambodia signed a MOU on the prevention of human trafficking and the rescue and repatriation of victims. The government permitted licensed foreign employment recruiters to charge migrant workers up to 20,000 INR ($310) for worker-paid recruitment fees and costs; however, observers stated migrant workers were frequently charged more than the maximum and obtained loans to pay the recruiters, thereby increasing their debt and vulnerability to labor trafficking. The government prohibited the role of unregulated and unregistered sub-agents; however, sub-agents reportedly continued to operate widely with impunity. MEA reportedly worked with the Central Bureau of Investigation to address cases of recruitment fraud and trafficking allegations and revoked recruitment licenses, but it did not report how many licenses it revoked during the reporting period. Within India, some states regulated aspects of the informal labor sector, including seven state governments that stipulated a minimum wage for domestic work. In October 2017, MoLE solicited public input on the formulation of a national domestic worker policy. The government amended the Child Labor (Abolition) Act in August 2016 to ban employment of children below the age of 14. The amended law also prohibited the employment of children between the ages of 14 and 18 in hazardous work except in mines; however, the law permitted employment of children in family-owned enterprises, involving nonhazardous activities, after school hours. Indian civil society continued to express concern that these changes amounted to legalizing some forms of child labor that would subsequently increase the vulnerability of children to trafficking. According to Indian child labor organizations, the number of labor inspectors was inadequate for the scope of work and inspectors could only inspect private farms or residences if a complaint had been filed. The central government's May 2016 revision of the bonded laborers rehabilitation program provided for the reimbursement of 450,000 INR ($7,060) per district for a census of bonded labor. In its June 2017 memo, MoLE outlined modifications to this provision, including that the central government will advance 50 percent of the amount required for conducting the surveys to the state and that five evaluation studies per year may be conducted. The government did not report if any state had conducted such surveys. Despite India being a destination for child sex tourism, the government did not report measures to reduce child sex tourism. In January 2018, the government of Andhra Pradesh appointed a panel of legal experts and civil society to make recommendations on which laws could be used to prosecute buyers of sex. The government did not report additional efforts to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts or forced labor. The Indian military conducted training on trafficking for its personnel before deployment on peacekeeping or similar missions. The government did not provide information about any anti-trafficking training provided to its diplomatic personnel. ","prosecution":"The government maintained law enforcement efforts. Indian law criminalized sex trafficking and some forms of labor trafficking. Section 370 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) criminalized slavery, servitude, and most forms of sex trafficking and prescribed penalties ranging from seven years to life imprisonment, which were sufficiently stringent and, with respect to sex trafficking, commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. Inconsistent with international law, Section 370 required a demonstration of force, fraud, or coercion to constitute a child sex trafficking offense, and therefore did not criminalize all forms of child sex trafficking. However, Sections 372 and 373 of the IPC criminalized the exploitation of children through prostitution without requiring a demonstration of such means, thereby addressing this gap. These sections prescribed penalties of up to ten years imprisonment and a fine, which were also sufficiently stringent and commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. Section 370 criminalized government officials' involvement in human trafficking and prescribed penalties up to life imprisonment. Bonded labor was specifically criminalized under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, which prescribed sufficiently stringent penalties of up to five years imprisonment, and the Bonded Labor System (Abolition) Act (BLSA), which prescribed penalties of up to three years imprisonment, which were not sufficiently stringent. The Juvenile Justice Act and other sections of the IPC criminalized many forms of forced labor; however, these provisions were unevenly enforced and some of their prescribed penalties were not sufficiently stringent, allowing for only fines or short prison sentences. The government frequently used the Immoral Traffic Prevention Act (ITPA) and various provisions of the IPC, which prescribed penalties that were sufficiently stringent and commensurate with other serious crimes such as rape, to prosecute sex trafficking. During the reporting period, the National Crimes Record Bureau (NCRB) issued the 2016 Crime in India Report, the most recent law enforcement data available. The 2016 report utilized different sections of law from previous years' reports by including additional sections of the penal code relevant to human trafficking and removing ITPA data from the reported totals for human trafficking, thereby making past data incomparable. The 2016 report also included IPC section 367 in its aggregated trafficking data despite this section covering crimes broader than trafficking; the government did not report if it had disaggregated non-trafficking crimes from the data. In 2016, police investigated 5,217 trafficking cases and the government completed the prosecution of 587 cases. Of these cases, courts convicted traffickers in 163 cases and acquitted individuals in 424 cases. The acquittal rate for trafficking cases increased from 65 percent in 2015 to 72 percent in 2016. The government did not publish the categorization of the cases between sex or labor trafficking. The NCRB did not include cases of bonded labor in the overall human trafficking statistics, but did separately report 114 investigations and 13 prosecutions of cases in 2016 under the BLSA. This was an increase from 77 investigations and seven case prosecutions in 2015. However, the courts' convictions under the BLSA remained notably low at only three in 2016 (compared to four in 2015), although bonded labor offenders may also be charged and convicted under other laws. The government did not report sentences for convictions. A senior police official noted at least one state did not report conviction data to the NCRB because of concern over the integrity of local data. Despite the overall increase in trafficking cases reported by the NCRB, NGOs continued to comment the figures did not reftect the large scale of human trafficking crimes in India, as many cases were not registered by police or were settled at the complaint stage. Inconsistent application of the law across jurisdictions, corruption among 223INDIAsome officials, and a lack of awareness or capacity in some parts of the country resulted in incidents of inaction on trafficking crimes by police and prosecutors. In February 2018, the Union Cabinet, chaired by the prime minister, approved the Trafficking in Persons (Prevention, Protection and Rehabilitation) Bill for introduction in the Parliament. If passed, the government reported the bill would address the issue of trafficking from the \ufb01point of view of prevention, rescue and rehabilitation,\ufb02 criminalize aggravated forms of trafficking, and create a national anti-trafficking bureau to comply with a December 2015 Supreme Court directive to establish an anti-trafficking investigative agency. The creation of such an agency was pending the passage of the anti-trafficking bill, although the Ministry of Women and Child Development (MWCD) had allocated 832 million Indian rupees (INR) ($13.1 million) to the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) for the agency. AHTUs continued to serve as the primary investigative force for human trafficking crimes. In the previous reporting period, MHA released funds to establish a total of 270 AHTUs out of the more than 600 districts. MHA reported 264 AHTUs were operational throughout the country during the reporting period, an increase of five compared with the previous reporting period. Some NGOs reported significant cooperation with AHTUs on investigations and police referral of victims to NGOs for rehabilitation services. However, other NGOs noted some AHTUs continued to lack clear mandates and were not solely dedicated to anti-trafficking, which created confusion with other district- and state-level police units and in some cases impeded their ability to proactively investigate cases. Some police offices reportedly used AHTU resources and personnel for non-trafficking cases. Coordination across states remained a significant challenge in cases where the alleged trafficker was located in a different state from the victim. NGOs noted some police offices were overburdened, underfunded, and lacked the necessary resources, such as vehicles and computers, to combat trafficking effectively. NGOs noted some prosecutors and judges did not have sufficient resources to properly prosecute and adjudicate cases. State and local governments partnered with NGOs and international organizations to train police, border guards, public prosecutors, railway police, and social welfare and judicial officers. MHA provided roughly 191,000 INR ($3,000) for Telangana and Andhra Pradesh to organize a judicial colloquium in December 2017 for 130 judges and prosecutors on sex trafficking. Official complicity in human trafficking occurred at varying levels of government. The government did not report comprehensive data on investigations, prosecutions, or convictions of government officials complicit in human trafficking offenses. The 2016 Crime in India Report, the most recent law enforcement data available, stated under the corruption act and related IPC sections, there were 4,764 officials charged, 1,071 officials convicted, and 1,947 officials acquitted in 2016; the government did not report whether any of the cases were related to human trafficking. Some corrupt law enforcement officers reportedly protected suspected traffickers and brothel owners from law enforcement action, received bribes from sex trafficking establishments and sexual services from victims, and tipped off sex and labor traffickers on forthcoming raids. Media quoted a Delhi government official as stating Delhi's red-light area had become a hub for human trafficking, especially of girls, and alleging the involvement of police, politicians, and local government officials. There were no reports of investigations into such cases of complicity for the second consecutive year. ","protection":"The government increased efforts to protect victims. The NCRB reported the government's identification of 22,955 victims in 2016, compared with 8,281 in 2015. The NCRB reported 11,212 of the victims were exploited in forced labor, 7,570 exploited in sex trafficking, 3,824 exploited in an unspecified manner, and 349 exploited in forced marriage, although it is unclear if the forced marriage cases directly resulted in forced labor or sex trafficking. The government did not disaggregate the type of exploitation experienced by the age, gender, or nationality of the victim and included a small number of non-trafficking crimes in its overall victim demographic numbers; thus the following information included 162 more persons than the total number of trafficking victims identified. The government identified 8,651 boys, 7,238 women, 5,532 girls, and 1,696 men as trafficking victims. Of the victims, 22,932 were Indian, 38 Sri Lankan, 38 Nepali, 36 Bangladeshi, and 73 were various other nationalities, including Thai and Uzbek. A 2009 MHA non-binding directive advised state officials to use SOPs for proactive victim identification and referral to protection services; however, it is unclear if all 29 states employed such SOPs. Some NGOs noted police did not use SOPs and were not proactive in their identification of potential victims; instead, police reportedly relied on NGOs to identify and report the location of the victim to the police for rescue. In December 2017, after consultations with civil society, the National Human Rights Commission created and published SOPs for combating human trafficking. These SOPs included information on the definition of trafficking, myths and misconceptions about trafficking, a screening tool to help identify potential victims, steps to rescue a victim including providing immediate care and support to the victim, and information on rehabilitation programs and restitution. MWCD's SOPs for cases of missing children, created in the previous reporting period, continued to mandate the transfer of cases not resolved within four months to an AHTU. MWCD and MHA continued to implement TrackChild, a system to identify missing children nationally. MWCD continued to support the national Childline hotline, an emergency phone service for children in need of assistance, including trafficking victims. State- and district-level law enforcement continued to carry out operations to rescue and rehabilitate missing and exploited children, some of whom may have been subjected to forced labor or sex trafficking. Some state- and district-level law enforcement actively partnered with NGOs to identify, rescue, and provide rehabilitation services to victims; however, other police officers reportedly undertook rescue operations without further investigating or charging suspects. MWCD continued to fund NGO- and government-run shelter and rehabilitation services for women and children through the Ujjawala program, specifically for female sex trafficking victims, and the Swadhar Greh program, for women in difficult circumstances. The central government's budget for the Ujjawala program increased from 203 million INR ($3.2 million) in 2016-2017 to 350 million INR ($5.5 million) in 2017-2018 and the Swadhar Greh budget decreased from 840 million INR ($13.2 million) to 750 million INR ($11.8 million). NGOs continued to report the number of government shelters was insufficient and overcrowding compromised victim rehabilitation. Both government- and NGO-run shelters faced shortages of financial resources and trained personnel, particularly of counselors and medical staff. NGOs relied primarily on donor contributions to provide victim services, although some received government funds. The disbursal of government funding to NGOs was sometimes delayed for multiple years and corruption reportedly drained some resources intended for victim care. Some victims waited months for transfer from temporary \ufb01transit homes\ufb02 224INDIAto shelters that provide long-term care due to shortages of government funds, shelter staff, or police escorts. Government child welfare committees placed child victims in private shelters or in government juvenile justice homes, some of which may have housed child victims with children accused of crimes. Children largely received the same government services as adults. Media reported allegations that some privately-run children's homes subjected children to trafficking. During the reporting period, police in Tamil Nadu charged the director of an unregistered children's home under trafficking and juvenile justice laws.In May 2016, the central government revised its program for the rehabilitation of bonded laborers to increase compensation and include female sex trafficking and child forced labor victims as eligible to receive restitution and assistance. In June 2017, the Ministry of Labor and Employment (MoLE) disseminated a memo to local and state governments clarifying parts of the 2016 program and outlining additional modifications. The memo clarified district administrations could provide immediate monetary assistance up to 20,000 INR ($310) to a victim released from bonded labor regardless of the status of a related court case. However, the release of the overall restitution amounts (between 100,000 INR [$1,570] and 300,000 INR [$4,710] based on the victim's demographics) remained contingent on the conviction of the trafficker or administrative processes that may take several years to conclude. Media and NGOs reported a small number of victims received initial monetary assistance; however, media also reported the inaction of districts and states on bonded labor in part due to a lack of funds. State governments were required to provide victims with immediate monetary assistance from state budgets and then request reimbursement from the central government. Judges could also order victim restitution through other government compensation programs. While these programs were also mostly based on the conviction of the trafficker, in August 2017 before a trial took place a judge ordered restitution of 300,000 INR ($4,710) to a child sex trafficking victim under the 2012 Prevention of Children Against Sexual Offenses Act's compensation fund. Rescued bonded laborers were entitled to \ufb01release certificates\ufb02 enabling them to receive government-funded services. Many victims received certificates at or soon after their rescue, especially in areas where there was significant coordination between the government and NGOs. Other victims experienced lengthy delays before obtaining the certificates. The government did not provide adult male trafficking victims, other than bonded labor victims, any protection services. Government-run hospitals provided emergency medical services to victims, although long waiting lists made it difficult to obtain surgery and other procedures and NGOs often had to pay for victims' emergency medical treatment. In August 2017, the district government of Jashpur, Chhattisgarh initiated a pilot program to provide ten female trafficking survivors a location and equipment to open a bakery. In March 2018, the President of the Republic of India awarded the bakery and the survivors the Nari Shakti Puraskar (Women Empowerment Award) and launched an NGO-run three-month course to build the confidence of trafficking survivors, assess their skills and educational levels, and connect them with the government-run Skill India program for vocational training. Media reported the government aimed to provide vocational training to 500,000 survivors in the future. Foreign victims received the same access to shelter and services as Indian nationals. Government policy on foreign victims dictated their return to their country of origin at the earliest possible time. Authorities detained foreign sex trafficking victims to government aftercare homes until repatriation and did not permit them to work in the local economy. The repatriation of foreign victims could take years due to a number of constraints, including some victims' lack of identity documents. NGOs stated children who could not identify their home state or country were unable to be returned to their families or place of origin. The governments of India and Bangladesh continued to implement their 2015 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on human trafficking, including through coordination on repatriation; Bangladeshi NGOs reported the average Bangladeshi victim was repatriated within six months. To protect both Indian and foreign national victims during trial, prosecutors may request the victim be permitted to testify by video or behind a screen, the proceeding be closed to the media and public, and irrelevant and potentially harmful questions be barred; it is unknown if these protections were used for trafficking victims during the reporting period. In 2009, MHA provided guidelines to all state governments encouraging police not to charge victims for crimes committed while subjected to human trafficking, including foreign women and child victims for immigration violations. However, in certain cases, the government continued to penalize victims as a result of inconsistent identification and screening efforts, including sex trafficking victims arrested for prostitution and foreign trafficking victims charged with immigration violations. In 2014, the government began denying travel of trafficking victims and their family members, including by confiscating the passports of Indians who received a visa from a foreign government indicating the person was a trafficking victim in the foreign country or was a family member of a victim. The government revised this policy in 2015 to allow these victims and their families to renew their passports and travel if documentation of the victim's trafficking experience was provided and the Indian government determined the person to be a trafficking victim. However, some victims continued to cite lengthy delays, requests from the government for private or otherwise sensitive information, and inconsistent application of the policy when attempting to renew their passports. In 2016 and 2017, the government stamped the passports of some recipients of the foreign government's visas, for both trafficking victims and their eligible family members, identifying them as trafficking victims involved in a particular investigation, civil, or criminal case. While the stamp requested authorities permit the visa holder to travel without hindrance, some NGOs familiar with this practice noted it made some victims fearful of reprisal and penalization and served as a deterrent to victims interacting with authorities. ","recommendation":"Increase prosecutions and convictions for all forms of trafficking, including forced and bonded labor, and of officials allegedly complicit in trafficking, respecting due process; establish and fully resource anti-human trafficking units (AHTUs) in all districts, including by providing additional dedicated, trained staff and by clarifying the mandate of AHTUs; significantly increase efforts to identify victims proactively to include disseminating and implementing standard operating procedures (SOPs) to harmonize victim identification and referral, and training officials on their use; cease the penalization of trafficking victims; protect victim confidentiality and privacy, including on government-issued identification documents; improve central and state government implementation of protection programs and compensation schemes to ensure trafficking victims receive benefits, release certificates, and compensation funds; develop and adopt a national action plan to combat trafficking; eliminate all recruitment fees charged to workers and raise awareness among workers that they are not required to pay for a job; promptly disburse government funding for shelters and develop monitoring mechanisms to ensure quality of care; continue to increase the transparency of government efforts to combat trafficking and provide disaggregated data on efforts to criminally investigate, prosecute, and punish sex and labor trafficking; lift the ban on female labor migration to certain countries to discourage migration through undocumented channels; provide funding for states to establish fast-track courts that deal with all forms of human trafficking; and provide anti-trafficking training or guidance for diplomatic personnel to prevent their engagement in or facilitation of trafficking crimes, and to provide personnel the tools to identify and assist trafficking victims in their work.","tier":"TIER 2","traffick_profile":"As reported over the past five years, India is a source, destination, and transit country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking. Forced labor constitutes India's largest trafficking problem; men, women, and children in debt bondage\u0160sometimes inherited from previous generations\u0160are forced to work in brick kilns, rice mills, embroidery factories, and agriculture. Most of India's trafficking problem is internal, and those from the most disadvantaged social strata\u0160lowest caste Dalits, members of tribal communities, religious minorities, and women and girls from excluded groups\u0160are most vulnerable. Within India, some are subjected to forced labor in sectors such as construction, steel, garment, and textile industries, wire manufacturing for underground cables, biscuit factories, pickling, ftoriculture, fish farms, and ship breaking. Workers within India who mine for sand are potentially vulnerable to human trafficking. Thousands of unregulated work placement agencies reportedly lure adults and children under false promises of employment into sex trafficking or forced labor, including domestic servitude. In addition to bonded labor, some children are subjected to forced labor as factory and agricultural workers, carpet weavers, domestic servants, and beggars. Begging ringleaders sometimes maim children to earn more money. Some NGOs and media report girls are sold and forced to conceive and deliver babies for sale. The \ufb01Provident Funds\ufb02 or \ufb01Sumangali\ufb02 scheme in Tamil Nadu, in which employers pay young women a lump sum, used for education or a dowry, at the end of multi-year labor contracts may amount to conditions of forced labor. Separatist groups, such as the Maoists in Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, West Bengal, and Odisha, force some children to act as spies and couriers, plant improvised explosive devices, and fight against the government, although reportedly to a lesser degree than previous years. Experts estimate millions of women and children are victims of sex trafficking in India. Traffickers use false promises of employment or arrange sham marriages within India or Gulf states and subject women and girls to sex trafficking. In 226INDONESIAaddition to traditional red light districts, women and children increasingly endure sex trafficking in small hotels, vehicles, huts, and private residences. Traffickers increasingly use websites, mobile applications, and online money transfers to facilitate commercial sex. Children continue to be subjected to sex trafficking in religious pilgrimage centers and by foreign travelers in tourist destinations. Many women and girls, predominately from Nepal and Bangladesh, and from Europe, Central Asia, Africa, and Asia, including Rohingya and other minority populations from Burma, are subjected to sex trafficking in India. Prime destinations for both Indian and foreign female trafficking victims include Kolkata, Mumbai, Delhi, Gujarat, Hyderabad, and along the India-Nepal border; Nepali women and girls are increasingly subjected to sex trafficking in Assam, and other cities such as Nagpur and Pune. Some corrupt law enforcement officers protect suspected traffickers and brothel owners from law enforcement efforts, take bribes from sex trafficking establishments and sexual services from victims, and tip off sex and labor traffickers to impede rescue efforts. Some Indian migrants who willingly seek employment in construction, domestic work, and other low-skilled sectors in the Middle East and, to a lesser extent, other regions, face forced labor, often following recruitment fraud and exorbitant recruitment fees charged by labor brokers. Girls from northeast India were reportedly vulnerable to human trafficking as they transited Burma on fake Burmese passports to circumvent the Indian government's required emigration clearance to migrate for work to certain countries. Some Bangladeshi migrants are subjected to forced labor in India through recruitment fraud and debt bondage. Some Nepali, Bangladeshi, and Afghan women and girls are subjected to both labor and sex trafficking in major Indian cities. Following the 2015 Nepal earthquakes, Nepali women who transit through India are increasingly subjected to trafficking in the Middle East and Africa. Some boys from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh are subjected to forced labor in embroidery factories in Nepal. Burmese Rohingya, Sri Lankan Tamil, and other refugee populations continue to be vulnerable to sex trafficking and forced labor in India.

The government demonstrated increasing efforts compared to the previous reporting period; therefore Indonesia remained on Tier 2. The government demonstrated increasing efforts by investigating, prosecuting, and convicting more traffickers, and identifying more victims compared to the previous year. It also repatriated and provided services to more Indonesian victims from overseas; implemented new regulations to prevent trafficking in the fishing industry; negotiated initiatives with the private sector to reduce vulnerability of Indonesian overseas workers; and conducted training for officials. The government convicted an immigration official under the 2007 anti-trafficking law and sentenced him to six years in prison in June 2017. However, the government did not meet the minimum standards in several key areas. Endemic corruption among officials remained, which impeded anti-trafficking efforts and enabled many traffickers to operate with impunity. The 2007 anti-trafficking law included a requirement of demonstrated force, fraud, or coercion to constitute a child sex trafficking crime, which is inconsistent with international law. Officials' lack of familiarity with trafficking indicators and anti-trafficking laws impaired proactive victim identification among vulnerable populations and hindered law enforcement efforts.

The national task force maintained 32 provincial-level task forces and 191 local and district-level task forces. The national task force held meetings in three provinces, attended by officials from 33 provinces, culminating in December 2017 with an evaluation of implementation of the plan of action. However, insufficient funding and lack of coordination within and between local task forces and with the national task force at times impeded anti-trafficking efforts. In October 2017, the government passed amendments to an overseas worker law that added sentencing guidelines for illegal recruitment crimes and limited the role of private recruitment and placement agencies by revoking their authority to obtain travel documents for migrant workers. The Indonesian consulate in the Malaysian state of Penang negotiated an agreement with several Malaysian companies to implement an electronic banking payment system to reduce Indonesian migrant workers' vulnerability to exploitation or extortion.To better protect Indonesian fishermen, the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF) began enforcing several new regulations to combat trafficking. The regulations obligated Indonesian fishery businesses to comply with international human rights protection standards, such as on work health and safety, recruitment, and security, and compliance became a prerequisite for obtaining permits for fish capture. The MMAF also started requiring state-owned fishing companies to include the regulations in their company by-laws and internal policies. An additional MMAF regulation allowed the government to apply a standardized work contract for Indonesian fishermen who work on domestic and foreign fishing vessels in both Indonesian and international waters. To address child trafficking, the government, in conjunction with two local NGOs, implemented the \ufb01Count Every Child Project,\ufb02 which ensured children are issued identity documents, such as birth registrations, thereby decreasing their vulnerability to trafficking. A recent World Bank study concluded Indonesia's 228INDONESIAhigh number of undocumented migrant workers was partly a result of its cumbersome bureaucratic registration procedures, which incentivized migrant workers to seek illegal brokers to obtain identity documents and visas for travel.The Ministry of Labor (MoL) broadened its efforts to reach domestic workers seeking employment abroad with specific training in domestic service skills and guidance on how to avoid traffickers and unlicensed brokers. Domestic workers employed in Indonesia also received training from the Association of Training and Placement for Domestic Workers Across Indonesia (APPSI). In 2017, the Batam Immigration Office rejected 511 passport applications from applicants intending to use their passports to work overseas illegally. Additionally, the MoL reported it foiled the departure of 1,310 overseas workers and revoked the license of one recruitment agency.In December 2017, the MFA re-launched its Safe Travel Application, which allowed the ministry to track identity and employment details of migrant workers abroad. The app featured a panic button that enabled vulnerable migrant workers abroad to request local assistance when in distress. It also contained contact information for Indonesian consulates and embassies around the world.Although the government continued its ban on overseas placement to 21 Middle East and North African nations, in October 2017, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia reached an agreement to permit Indonesian migrant workers to apply for visas in the domestic sector and announced a 24-hour protection mechanism that enabled Indonesian migrant workers to seek assistance for contract switching. With a legal avenue to seek work in Saudi Arabia, migrant workers were less likely to seek the assistance of illegal recruiters and become trafficking victims.The MFA conducted public awareness campaign programs in eight migrant worker source regions and in China. The ministry also organized 10 national radio talk shows and distributed printed material to 16 regencies in Indonesia. The Ministry of Tourism conducted public awareness campaigns to prevent sex tourism and initiated community empowerment programs to prevent the sexual exploitation of children and women. The government also collaborated with 10 universities to disseminate information about safe migration to people seeking employment abroad; more than 2,500 students joined the information sessions.The government provided anti-trafficking training for military personnel prior to their deployment abroad on international peacekeeping missions, and it conducted training on trafficking victim identification and domestic migrant worker protections for diplomatic personnel. The MFA partnered with South Africa to create a pilot program to assist Indonesians working on foreign fishing vessels. The program collected data through a dedicated center with fishermen and was intended to help the MFA monitor Indonesian fishermen overseas to prevent trafficking. Officials plan to expand the program to Mauritius and other locations with high numbers of visiting Indonesian fishermen.","prosecution":"The government increased law enforcement efforts. The 2007 anti-trafficking law criminalized all forms of labor trafficking and sex trafficking of adults and prescribed penalties of three to 15 years imprisonment, which were sufficiently stringent and, with respect to sex trafficking, commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. Inconsistent with international law, the law required a demonstration of force, fraud, or coercion to constitute a child sex trafficking offense, and therefore did not criminalize all forms of child sex trafficking.Corrupt officials reportedly continued to facilitate the issuance of false documents, accepted bribes to allow brokers to transport undocumented migrants across borders, protected venues where sex trafficking occurred, practiced weak oversight of recruitment agencies, and thwarted law enforcement and judicial processes to hold traffickers accountable. However, the government did convict an immigration official under the 2007 anti-trafficking law and sentenced him to six years in prison in June 2017. The government ratified the ASEAN Convention against Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, through passage of Law No.122017. The Law expanded the government's authority to prosecute suspects for illegal recruitment and provided a legal basis for Indonesian law enforcement agencies to collaborate with other ASEAN countries.227INDONESIAOfficials reported ineffective coordination among police, witnesses, prosecutors, and judges continued to hinder the government's ability to investigate, prosecute, and convict traffickers, especially when cases involved numerous jurisdictions or other countries. The national police anti-trafficking unit did not have a mechanism to track trafficking investigations at the national, provincial, and district level, making it difficult to determine the total number of investigations and resolved cases. The police reported 123 new trafficking investigations in 2017, up from 110 in 2016. The national police also reported referring 51 investigations to the attorney general's office in 2017. The Supreme Court implemented a comprehensive prosecutorial recordkeeping mechanism, but statistical discrepancies continued due to lack of coordination with law enforcement entities, whose own informal self-monitoring practices remained underdeveloped. The Supreme Court reported 407 new trafficking prosecutions during 2017, an increase compared to 263 reported the previous year and a result of improved data collection. The Supreme Court also reported 324 convictions, compared to 190 in the previous year; sentences ranged from two and a half years up to seven years. The Attorney General's Office conducted training for 580 prosecutor candidates and coordinated with an NGO to create trafficking guide books for law enforcement officials. Other ministries provided training for law enforcement from nine provinces, including 22 districts in East Nusa Tenggara (NTT), as well as for 71 members of the illegal fishing task force.","protection":"The government maintained protection efforts. Although officials at the national level did not collect comprehensive data, they identified 5,801 victims. The Commission for the Protection of Children officially identified 293 suspected child trafficking victims. However, the government did not report if identification led to investigations or the provision of victim protective services. A local NGO estimated as many as 80,000 children were exploited for sex trafficking in 2017. A draft law on the protection of domestic workers in Indonesia continued to stall in the national legislature. An international organization reported trafficking victims were often unaware of government reintegration services, including training on how to start a small business, and follow-up services for victims who had departed shelters remained insufficient. The Ministry of Health (MOH) was responsible for funding victims' health care, which national police hospitals were obligated to provide free of charge. The MOH trained hospital personnel to provide health services to victims of trafficking and violence in 12 provinces during 2017, including physical and psychological treatment by trained paramedics and health service personnel at community health centers and hospitals. The government's overseas crisis center complaint system received 4,475 complaints from workers placed overseas, including 71 confirmed trafficking cases and 2,430 cases with trafficking indicators. Although the government reportedly initiated investigations based on these complaints, the government did not report the results. Seven ministries jointly finalized a screening form for staff at Indonesian embassies overseas to identify trafficking victims and as a reference in trafficking-related investigations. In May 2017, the national police and the Attorney General's Office, supported by the Indonesian embassy in Kuala Lumpur, used the screening form to identify 40 Indonesian trafficking victims. The government repatriated 340 suspected trafficking victims from overseas, compared with 602 in 2016. The government provided returning victims with short-term shelter and reintegration assistance, and it referred them to local government entities for further care. The government's witness protection unit provided legal assistance to approximately 257 trafficking victims, compared to 165 in 2016. Since multiple agencies provided legal assistance with varying degrees of adherence to recordkeeping protocols, the total number who received such aid is unknown. In August 2017, the Supreme Court issued a decree on Guidelines to Prosecute Women Facing Legal Cases. The guidelines specify that judges should protect female victims during the case review, conviction, and judicial review phases of legal processes by considering gender equality and psychological trauma. The decree also included guidelines to prevent re-traumatization by allowing video testimony. The government facilitated restitution payments for 54 victims during the year. There were no reports that the government punished victims for crimes committed as a result of being subjected to trafficking, but inadequate efforts to screen vulnerable groups for trafficking indicators, including during raids to arrest persons in prostitution or combat illegal fishing, may have resulted in the punishment or deportation of unidentified trafficking victims. The government did not provide legal alternatives to the removal of foreign victims to countries where they may face hardship or retribution. ","recommendation":"Investigate, prosecute, and convict corrupt public officials that willfully ignore, facilitate, or engage in trafficking crimes; amend the 2007 law to remove the required demonstration of force, fraud, or coercion to constitute child sex trafficking; increase efforts to effectively monitor labor recruitment agencies and brokers and investigate, prosecute, and convict traffickers; refine procedures to identify potential victims among vulnerable groups, including returning migrant workers, persons in prostitution, and fishing vessel crewmembers; train marine ministry staff and labor inspectors on victim identification and referral procedures; provide anti-trafficking training for judges, prosecutors, police, and social workers; take steps to eliminate recruitment fees charged to workers by labor recruiters; proactively offer identified victim reintegration services; promote safe and legal migration with trafficking prevention measures; increase resources for the anti-trafficking task force and improve its coordination across ministries; establish a data collection system to track anti-trafficking efforts at all levels of law enforcement; train hospital staff and other health care providers about provisions guaranteeing government-funded care for trafficking victims; and create a national protocol that clarifies roles for prosecuting trafficking cases outside victims' home provinces.","tier":"TIER 2","traffick_profile":"As reported over the past five years, Indonesia is a major source, and to a much lesser extent, destination and transit country for women, men, and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking. Each of its 34 provinces is a source and destination of trafficking. The government estimates 1.9 million of the 4.5 million Indonesians working abroad\u0160many of whom are women\u0160are undocumented or have overstayed their visas, increasing their vulnerability to trafficking. The actual figure is likely higher, as a significant number of migrant workers traditionally circumvent government overseas placement and permitting requirements, often at the instigation of traffickers. A significant number of Indonesians are exploited in forced labor and debt bondage in Asia and the Middle East, primarily in domestic service, factories, construction, and manufacturing, on Malaysian palm oil plantations, and on fishing vessels throughout the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Malaysia remains the top destination for Indonesian migrant workers; the government estimates more than one million of the 1.9 million Indonesian workers in irregular status are in Malaysia.Indonesian women and girls are subjected to sex trafficking, primarily in Malaysia, Taiwan, and the Middle East. Domestic workers account for the biggest group of Indonesian women who work in Indonesia as well as Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong and the Middle East, but they are not considered formal workers and are unprotected under local labor laws. Excessive working hours, lack of a formal contract, and unpaid wages are some of the most common abuses Indonesian domestic helpers face. NGOs estimate labor recruiters are responsible for more than half of Indonesian female trafficking cases overseas. Migrant workers often accumulate significant debt from both Indonesian and overseas labor recruitment outfits, making them vulnerable to debt bondage. Some companies use debt bondage, withholding of documents, and threats of violence to keep migrants in forced labor. Endemic corruption among government officials facilitates practices that contribute to trafficking vulnerabilities in the travel, hospitality, and labor recruitment industries.In Indonesia, women, men, and children are exploited in forced labor in fishing, fish processing, and construction; on plantations, including palm oil; and in mining and manufacturing. Many women and girls are exploited in domestic servitude and sex trafficking. Victims are often recruited with offers of jobs in restaurants, factories, or domestic service, but are subjected to sex trafficking. Debt bondage is particularly prevalent among sex trafficking victims. Women and girls are subjected to sex trafficking near mining operations in Maluku, Papua, and Jami provinces. Child sex tourism is prevalent in the Riau Islands bordering Singapore, and Bali is a destination for Indonesians traveling to engage in child sex tourism.Indonesian fishermen working on foreign-ftagged vessels reported pervasive abuse, forced labor, unpaid salaries, and, in some cases, allegations of murder. They worked on Taiwan, Thai, Malaysian, and Philippines-ftagged fishing vessels operating in Indonesia and in the waters of Thailand, Sri Lanka, Mauritius, and India. Dozens of recruitment agencies in Burma, Indonesia, and Thailand hire fishermen, assign them fake identity and labor permit documents, and force them to fish long hours in waters for low or unpaid salaries while incurring severe physical abuse. The fishermen were prohibited from leaving their vessels and reporting these abuses by threats of exposing their fake identities to the authorities or by detaining them on land in makeshift prisons. More than 7,000 Indonesian fishermen per year sign in and out of foreign vessels at the port in Cape Town, South Africa, reportedly facing dire working conditions, particularly on vessels owned by Taiwan, Korea, and Japan.229IRAN"},"Iraq":{"April":17.0,"Asylum Seekers":"273","August":11.0,"December":12.0,"February":13.0,"Friday":21.0,"Global Population":38433.6,"January":22.0,"July":20.0,"June":18.0,"Life Expectancy":70.45,"March":18.0,"May":16.0,"Monday":27.0,"November":13.0,"October":12.0,"Population below $1.90 a day":"2.5","Saturday":16.0,"September":11.0,"Sunday":26.0,"Thursday":26.0,"Tuesday":36.0,"Violence against civilians":183,"Wednesday":31.0,"fatalities":["1","0","0","1","1","1","3","0","0","1","2","1","0","1","0","0","3","1","1","1","1","3","0","1","1","0","2","5","1","1","2","1","3","9","2","1","2","1","0","1","1","1","0","2","1","4","0","1","5","3","1","0","1","1","2","1","0","1","0","2","4","1","2","1","1","0","1","1","2","1","1","1","1","1","0","1","7","4","1","0","0","2","4","1","1","7","0","10","0","1","0","0","1","0","0","2","12","1","2","1","0","1","0","0","2","0","0","0","0","0","1","16","0","1","0","0","2","0","1","1","2","4","0","1","1","1","1","1","0","0","1","4","4","2","0","4","1","0","6","10","1","10","0","2","3","4","15","1","3","1","1","1","3","3","0","1","7","1","3","1","0","1","0","0","1","0","2","1","1","1","1","1","1","2","3","1","1","1","0","1","1","1","3"],"government_effort":"NA","introduction":"The Government of Iraq does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. The government demonstrated significant efforts during the reporting period by prosecuting and convicting more traffickers and investigating some complicit officials. It also reported identifying more trafficking victims in comparison to the previous reporting period. The government established a national inter-ministerial committee to monitor, evaluate, and report on children in armed conftict in Iraq, which included child soldiering. However, the government did not demonstrate increasing efforts compared to the previous reporting period; therefore Iraq remained on Tier 2 Watch List for the second consecutive year. Although the government identified trafficking victims, deficiencies in the government's identification and referral procedures prevented many victims from receiving appropriate protection services; the government-run trafficking shelter in Baghdad reportedly remained empty throughout 2017. The government did not investigate allegations that some militia units unlawfully recruited and used child soldiers in 2017, including units of the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) operating under the Popular Mobilization Committee (PMC), a component of the Iraqi armed forces. The government did not hold anyone criminally accountable despite several years of such allegations. The government continued to punish some trafficking victims for crimes committed as a result of being subjected to trafficking, such as child soldiering, prostitution, and immigration violations.

Iraqi law prohibited voluntary recruitment of any person under age 18 into the governmental armed forces, including governmental paramilitary forces, militia groups, or other armed groups. However, the federal government faced challenges in exercising complete control over certain units of the PMF, which sometimes undertook operations independent of political leaders or military commanders and discounted the authority of commanders during sanctioned operations. The government had limited ability to address and prevent the recruitment and use of children by these groups, including some units of AAH and KH militias. The government also did not prevent PMF units in southern Iraq from child recruitment and sponsoring military training camps for high school students, which included some children under the age of 18. However, to dissuade PMF commanders from accepting children who volunteered to fight, the government refused to enroll child volunteers in payment programs and did not provide salaries for any child volunteers. There were no reports of child soldiers used within the Iraqi military including the KRG Peshmerga, and the government continued to provide training to military officers on child soldier issues. In November 2017, the government\u0160with prime ministerial endorsement\u0160established a national inter-ministerial senior committee to monitor, evaluate, and report on children's rights violations in conftict zones in Iraq. Under the authority of the committee, which was led by MOLSA, the prime minister's office supported a future initiative to work with an international organization to draft a national action plan to address children in armed conftict. As of late January 2018, however, the committee had not met and the plan had not been drafted. Budget shortfalls, internal conftict, and vast reconstruction needs limited the Iraqi government's ability to dedicate resources to combat trafficking, including resources for the assistance and protection of trafficking victims. Likewise, contacts in the IKR reported that KRG funding for anti-trafficking efforts was insufficient. Nevertheless, the Iraqi government's inter-ministerial anti-trafficking committee, which was led by the MOI, reportedly met five times in 2017. The KRG also maintained an anti-trafficking committee, which was established in 2016 and consisted of various ministries, including an international organization that played an observer role. The Iraqi government reportedly undertook awareness campaigns in print media, television, and radio, and through seminars at universities. The government continued to operate a 24-hour anti-trafficking hotline, but it did not report how many potential trafficking cases officials identified through this hotline. Similarly, the KRG operated a hotline where trafficking victims could seek assistance and report labor abuses. The Iraqi government did not make efforts to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts or child sex tourism. The Iraqi government and the KRG took efforts to reduce the demand for forced labor; both governments cooperated with each other to establish an online visa system to track migrant workers and their sponsoring companies to prevent employers from committing labor abuses. Both governments also coordinated to standardize work contracts to include labor rights information for foreign and Iraqi workers. The Iraqi government suspended the operations of 15 recruitment companies, blacklisted five, and imposed fines on seven during the reporting period. The KRG reported that it temporarily suspended the operations of 38 companies and imposed fines on six companies for trafficking allegations. The Iraqi government reported that it provided anti-trafficking training or guidance for its employees, including diplomatic personnel.","prosecution":"The government increased law enforcement efforts, but it failed to prosecute or convict officials complicit in trafficking, including sex trafficking and child soldiering. Iraq's 2012 anti-trafficking law criminalized some forms of labor and sex trafficking. Inconsistent with the definition of trafficking under international law, the law required a demonstration of force, fraud, or coercion to constitute a child sex trafficking offense and therefore did not criminalize all forms of child sex trafficking. Additionally, the law required an individual to be sold to be considered a trafficking victim. An article in the penal code criminalized \ufb01the prostitution of a child\ufb02 and provided a penalty of up to 10 years imprisonment, which was sufficiently stringent to deter the crime, although not commensurate with the penalties prescribed for rape. The anti-trafficking law prescribed penalties of up to 15 years imprisonment and a fine of up to 10 million Iraqi dinars ($8,580) for trafficking offenses involving adult male victims, and up to life imprisonment and a fine of 15 million to 25 million Iraqi dinars ($12,860 to $21,440) if the offense involved an adult female or child victim. These penalties were sufficiently stringent, and with respect to sex trafficking, commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. The labor law confticted with the anti-trafficking law, as its penalties included a fine and imprisonment not exceeding six months, which were not sufficiently stringent. The government continued to lack implementing regulations for the anti-trafficking law, hindering its ability to enforce the law, bring traffickers to justice, and protect victims. The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) did not have a law that specifically prohibited all forms of human trafficking and the national anti-trafficking law did not apply in the IKR.The government reported investigating 266 potential trafficking cases in 2017 (314 in 2016), of which the Ministry of Interior (MOI) determined 40 to be alleged forced labor cases and 68 to be suspected sex trafficking cases; it determined the remaining 158 cases did not involve human trafficking crimes. The MOI reported it prosecuted 68 individuals on trafficking charges and convicted 22 traffickers under the anti-trafficking law in 2017, but it did not provide additional details on these cases. The MOI also investigated 48 alleged perpetrators for knowingly soliciting sex trafficking victims, of which 10 were prosecuted and convicted for human trafficking crimes under the anti-trafficking law. These prosecution and conviction efforts demonstrated a significant increase in comparison to 17 prosecutions and convictions in 2016. Nevertheless, according to NGOs, the government did not initiate a trafficking prosecution unless a victim pressed charges, yet most victims did not do so because they did not know the identity of their trafficker or were fearful of retaliation. During the reporting period, the KRG reported it conducted 58 investigations into abuses against foreign workers, but it did not report prosecuting or convicting any trafficking perpetrators. Significant concerns of alleged official complicity in trafficking crimes remained, including unlawful recruitment and use of child soldiers and sex trafficking. The government reported some efforts to investigate government officials complicit in 232IRAQhuman trafficking offenses, but it did not report efforts to prosecute or convict complicit officials. The government did not report efforts to investigate brothels across the country that civil society organizations believed to hold sex trafficking victims; local officials were allegedly aware of these brothels and allowed them to continue to operate. The government did not report efforts to investigate, prosecute, or convict alleged perpetrators of child soldiering among PMF units as reported in 2016. The government also did not report efforts to investigate allegations in 2017 that units of Asa'ib Ahl al-Haq (AAH) or Kata'ib Hizbullah (KH) militias\u0160some of which operated under the PMC\u0160recruited and used child soldiers. In early 2017, Iraq's Higher Judicial Council repealed a directive from 2016 that established specialized courts in Iraq to handle trafficking cases; therefore during the reporting period the government did not offer specialized judges or court settings to oversee trafficking cases. During the reporting period, the MOI provided training for its personnel on the anti-trafficking law and victim identification, while the Baghdad Governor's Office partially sponsored an anti-trafficking training session with civil society organizations and various government ministries in September 2017. ","protection":"The government increased efforts to identify trafficking victims and provided limited protection services to some victims. Deficiencies in the government's identification and referral procedures prevented many victims from receiving care and therefore victims remained highly vulnerable to punishment for crimes committed as a direct result of being subjected to trafficking. The Iraqi government reported it identified 41 victims, which included seven child trafficking victims, 22 female victims of both sex and labor trafficking, and 12 male victims of forced labor in 2017. This represents an increase from the previous reporting period, as the government did not report identifying any victims in 2016. Of these victims, the MOI reported it referred five of the child victims to the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (MOLSA) for care, but it did not report if it referred the other identified victims to assistance. Government officials reported victim identification efforts remained low because, in practice, judges were the only officials who could officially identify and refer a trafficking victim to protection services; however, because judges required victims to testify in front of their perpetrators in court, most victims did not come forward due to their fear of retaliation. The government did not institute government-wide victim identification guidelines for all relevant officials and first responders who came in contact with potential trafficking victims among vulnerable groups, including undocumented foreign migrants and persons in prostitution. However, the MOI reported it utilized internal procedures to guide law enforcement officials in identifying trafficking victims. The MOI also reported it trained personnel to identify potential labor trafficking cases. MOLSA reported it conducted periodic labor inspections of sites where foreign migrants were employed to ensure employers were not violating labor laws or committing potential labor trafficking crimes. It did not, however, report if any of these inspections resulted in the identification of labor trafficking victims during the reporting period. Trafficking victims in Iraq and the IKR continued to be vulnerable to arrest, imprisonment, and deportation for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being subjected to human trafficking, such as prostitution, immigration violations, and child soldiering. In May 2017, an international organization reported that unidentified PMF militia members detained, interrogated, and physically abused a 15-year-old boy for two days for alleged affiliation with ISIS, after he was caught fteeing ISIS-controlled area in west Mosul; there was no indication authorities screened the boy for trafficking or referred him to victim care. Local experts reported concerns that a significant number of sex trafficking victims faced criminal prosecution during the reporting period. Sources reported that in some instances, judges wrongfully convicted sex trafficking victims of committing prostitution violations that they were forced to commit, including child sex trafficking victims. Sentences for prostitution violations in Iraqi courts ranged from 15 years to life imprisonment, and applied to both adults and children. During the reporting period, foreign labor trafficking victims were vulnerable to paying immigration fines, and the MOI reported that trafficking victims could face penalties for using falsified documents. Although the anti-trafficking law required the government to institute a formal referral process to refer victims to protection services, in practice, government officials did not regularly refer identified victims to care, likely due to deficiencies in the government's identification procedures. The Iraqi government and the KRG provided limited protection services to victims of all forms of trafficking, and victim care varied by location. The Iraqi government re-opened a MOLSA-run trafficking shelter in Baghdad in August 2017, which was closed in 2016 due to security concerns. Fifteen specially-trained employees staffed the shelter and it was available for male, female, and child victims. MOI reported that it referred five child trafficking victims to this shelter in 2017; however, as of December 2017, NGOs reported the shelter remained unused during the reporting period. MOLSA reported it provided care for 25 children with familial ties to ISIS during the reporting period, but it did not report what type of support it provided, nor did it report funding specific programming to demobilize former ISIS child soldiers. The Iraqi government did not provide funding or in-kind assistance to NGOs providing victim care. NGOs were not allowed to legally operate shelters, but some continued operation without official approval. The KRG continued to operate three shelters in the IKR for female victims of domestic violence and trafficking; however, shelter space and service delivery were limited and the shelters primarily served domestic violence victims. Trafficking victims were always required to report trafficking or other crimes to the police first, which prevented them from receiving assistance at the shelters. The KRG did not report how many trafficking victims received services at these shelters during the reporting period. Recognizing gaps in protection services, the KRG entered into an agreement with a civil society organization in March 2017 to open a new shelter that would provide psycho-social support services for victims of trafficking and gender-based violence; although the shelter did not open during the reporting period, the agreement stipulated that the KRG will provide the facility with security, food, medical care, and administrative staff. The Iraqi government reported it provided services and compensation for victims of ISIS crimes of sexual violence and provided survivors with protection, rehabilitation, compensation, and other forms of support. The Iraqi government reported it allocated 1 billion Iraqi dinar ($857,630) for Yezidi victims in 2017; however, hundreds of rescued Yezidis reportedly did not receive compensation. The KRG continued to provide limited essential services to victims of ISIS, including shelter, rehabilitation, medical care, and psycho-social assistance. In 2017, the KRG facilitated and funded the release of 356 Yezidis held captive by ISIS, most of whom were likely trafficking victims. 233IRAQThe MOI reported that any foreign or Iraqi trafficking victim could file a civil lawsuit against a trafficker, but no victims filed such lawsuits in 2017. Neither the Iraqi government nor the KRG encouraged victims to assist in investigations and prosecutions of trafficking offenders. The Iraqi government and the KRG did not provide foreign victims relief from deportation or offer legal alternatives to their removal to countries in which they may face hardship or retribution. Although the Iraqi anti-trafficking law allowed for the government to provide special residency status benefits to foreign trafficking victims, it did not report offering this assistance to any victims during the reporting period. The KRG did not offer special residency status to victims during the reporting period, but it reportedly refrained from deporting victims unless they committed a crime. The Iraqi government reported that it did not assist in the repatriation of any trafficking victims during the reporting period. The KRG reported it cooperated with the consulates of Egypt, India, Jordan, the Philippines, and Sudan to help repatriate an unknown number of trafficking victims from those countries during the reporting period. ","recommendation":"Hold complicit officials accountable for unlawful recruitment and use of child soldiers and provide protection services to child soldiers and other trafficking victims; continue to make efforts to stop the recruitment and use of child soldiers by all armed groups, including units of the PMF and independent militias; ensure trafficking victims are not punished for crimes committed as a direct result of being subjected to human trafficking, such as prostitution and immigration violations; allow all first responders to officially identify potential trafficking victims and refer them to care regardless of whether a victim presses charges against his or her trafficker; develop and institute guidelines for proactive victim identification and referral to protection services for all relevant officials, and train officials on these procedures; increase unhindered access to adequate protection services for victims of all forms of trafficking and their children, including trauma and psycho-social counseling, and medical care, long-term shelter, reintegration services, employment training, and financial assistance; amend the anti-trafficking law to prohibit and punish all forms of trafficking consistent with the 2000 UN TIP Protocol; allow victims and witnesses to participate in legal proceedings against their traffickers; make significant efforts to investigate, prosecute, convict, and stringently sentence traffickers, including complicit government officials, even when victims do not press charges or participate in legal proceedings against their trafficker; finalize regulations to enable full implementation of the anti-trafficking law; establish a legal framework for NGOs to operate shelters for victims and support such organizations; and establish and implement a legal framework in the entire country, including the Iraqi Kurdistan Region (IKR), that criminalizes all forms of human trafficking and prescribes sufficiently stringent penalties.","tier":"TIER 2 WATCH LIST","traffick_profile":"As reported over the past five years, Iraq is a source and destination country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking and men, women, and children subjected to forced labor. The violent conftict with ISIS exacerbated the population's vulnerability to trafficking, in particular women and children, although the government's territorial defeat of the terrorist group, announced December 9, 2017, has improved conditions for Iraqi civilians. Since January 2014, more than five million Iraqis have been displaced, with approximately 2.1 million still displaced as of April 2018. In addition, more than 248,000 Syrian refugees remained displaced in Iraq, the vast majority in the IKR. Since 2014, ISIS militants have kidnapped and held captive thousands of women and children from a wide range of ethnic and religious groups, especially Yezidis, and continue to sell them to ISIS fighters in Iraq and Syria, where they are subjected to forced marriage, sexual slavery, rape, and domestic servitude. There are reports ISIS executed captives if they refused to marry fighters. The media has reported in the last few years that ISIS sold some captives to wealthy individuals in Gulf countries, and unverified reports suggested that some Yezidi captives have been moved to Syria, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia. ISIS maintained an organized system to buy and sell women and girls for sexual slavery, including sales contracts notarized by ISIS-run courts. In 2015-2017, thousands of women and children escaped ISIS captivity\u0160many of whom were pregnant as a result of rape and sex trafficking. Some became IDPs because ISIS still controlled their homelands. Those who remain IDPs continue to be highly vulnerable to various forms of exploitation, including re-trafficking.Children remain highly vulnerable to forcible recruitment and use by multiple armed groups operating in Iraq, including\u0160but not limited to\u0160ISIS, the PMF, tribal forces, the Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK), and Iran-backed militias. These children are also highly vulnerable to arrest, detention, and prosecution; at the end of March 2017, an international organization reported 943 children, including four girls, remained in detention on terrorism-related charges across the country. ISIS continues to abduct and forcibly recruit and use children in combat and support roles, including as human shields, informants, bomb makers, executioners, and suicide bombers; some of these children are as young as 8 years old and some are mentally 234IRAQdisabled. ISIS continues to train children at military training and indoctrination camps; numerous media reports and public videos show children attending these camps. In January 2017, international media and KRG sources reported that ISIS abducted 400 Yezidi children and trained them for combat roles, including as suicide bombers, while in the same month ISIS abducted 150 children from Tal Afar and forcibly recruited them into a training camp. As of early 2018, multiple sources reported the PKK and YPG operating in the IKR continued to recruit and use children. In mid-2017, international observers witnessed armed 16-year-old boys affiliated to the PKK. As reported by an international NGO in late 2016, the PKK and Sinjar Resistance Units\u0160a Yezidi armed militia group\u0160forcibly recruited and used Kurdish and Yezidi boys and girls, some as young as 12 years old, in combat and support roles in northern Iraq. Since 2015, sources continue to report that PMF units recruit, use, and provide military training to children. An expert in Baghdad assessed that the rate of such recruitment and use of children did not change in 2017. Civil society organizations and local contacts reported in 2017 that posters commemorating minors who died while fighting for Shia militias were commonplace in Shia-majority areas of Baghdad and throughout southern Iraq. Most of the children who were celebrated for fighting allegedly fought for brigades of the AAH and KH militias. Some AAH and KH members or brigades recruit children, most commonly out of schools. Sources reported that AAH and KH militias, which had units both within the PMF and operating independently, recruited and used child soldiers in 2017. According to the PMF official social media site and posters in the street in mid-2017, the PMF offered military training courses to children and youth ages 15-25. In April 2017, an international organization received credible reports that Sunni tribal militias recruited 300 boys aged 15-17 from Kilo 18 IDP camp. In 2017, some IDPs reported that some Sunni tribal militias recruited children out of camps for military training, with the possibility of joining armed groups upon completing the training. In mid-2017, international observers witnessed five boys manning checkpoints at an IDP camp in Ninewa; whose security was reportedly run by an official that fell under the PMF. In August 2017, there were unverified reports that PMF militias provided a three-month military training to 100 Shia Turkoman teenage boys, between the ages of 13-18, in several Kirkuk governorate towns. In 2015 and 2016, multiple sources reported factions of the PMF used children in operations in Fallujah and other areas of the country, while PMF-affiliated media celebrated the service and sacrifice of child soldiers. An international organization reported a total of 57 children were recruited and used in 2016 by groups operating under the umbrella of the PMF, most of whom received military training and were deployed for combat, while 12 children were recruited by tribal mobilization groups, including from internally displaced persons camps. As reported in 2015 and 2016, some PMF groups accepted children into their ranks from poor neighborhoods in Basrah, who left school to \ufb01volunteer\ufb02 for the PMF; many of them viewed this as fulfilling a religious duty, while others viewed it as a way to earn a living and gain greater social status. According to NGOs and tribal force commanders in 2015, children fighting with the PMF were unregistered and did not receive state benefits or regular salaries. In August 2016, an international NGO reported that Sunni tribal militias affiliated with the PMF recruited at least seven children from the Debaga IDP camp in northern Iraq; witness accounts reported that Iraqi Security Forces members facilitated the recruitment of children from the camp.Refugees and IDPs face heightened risk of trafficking due to their economic and social vulnerability and lack of security and protections. NGOs report trafficking networks in the IKR target refugees and IDPs, operating with assistance from local officials, including judges, officials from the Asayish forces, and border agents. In 2015, members of the IKR Parliament and NGOs reported some personnel from the Asayish forces facilitated the sex trafficking of women and girls in Syrian refugee camps in the IKR, primarily in Domiz refugee camp, as well as sex trafficking of girls outside of the camps. In 2016, NGOs reported Asayish guards not only allowed men to enter a camp to solicit commercial sex with refugee girls, but the guards also solicited sex from the refugee girls, including granting them permission to leave the camp in exchange for sex. Reports from 2015 indicated IDPs and some Syrian refugee women were forced into prostitution by a trafficking network in hotels and brothels in Baghdad, Basrah, and other cities in southern Iraq after agents of the network promised to resettle them from the IKR; the women's children were also forced to beg on the street. Some women in IDP camps, whose family members have alleged ties to ISIS, are vulnerable to sexual exploitation and abuse by armed actors residing in the camps. Some Syrian refugee men enter into employment without legal work contracts in Iraq, which increased their vulnerability to trafficking. Some displaced Iraqi families reportedly sell their children to other families to secure better futures for them; these children are at risk of trafficking. Traditional practices, including child forced and \ufb01temporary\ufb02 marriages and fasliya\u0160the exchange of family members to settle tribal disputes\u0160also place women and girls at increased risk of trafficking within the country. For example, in October 2016, the media reported a girl from the Nada tribe in Maysan Province was forced to marry a man of another tribe as a resolution for the killing of a man by someone in the Nada tribe. Child protection organizations continue to report incidents of child marriage\u0160which could increase a child's vulnerability to exploitation\u0160increased among IDPs and Syrian refugees in the IKR, as heads of households sought ways to generate income and reduce the family's economic burden. Syrian girls from refugee camps in the IKR are forced into early or \ufb01temporary marriages\ufb02 with Iraqi or other refugee men; some KRG authorities allegedly ignore, or may accept bribes to ignore, such cases, including those in which girls are sold multiple times. Reports continue to suggest some Iraqi law enforcement officials have allegedly frequented brothels known for sex trafficking or accepted bribes to allow sex trafficking. Media and other observers reported in 2015 that an Iranian sex trafficking network operated brothels in Erbil where Iranian girls were exploited in commercial sex; the media reported a KRG official allegedly paid $3,000 for an Iranian sex trafficking victim. There were anecdotal reports, including from a June 2016 local television station, of child sex trafficking of girls primarily from Iran and Syria, as well as some from the IKR, in Sulaimaniya. NGOs also report cases in which girls who have run away from their families out of fear of honor killings are exploited in commercial sex by criminal networks. Criminal gangs reportedly force children to beg and sell drugs in Iraq. Trafficking networks also reportedly sell Iraqi children in neighboring countries and Europe for commercial sexual exploitation. Iraqi women and girls are also subjected to sex and labor trafficking in the Middle East and Turkey.Some men and women from throughout Asia and East Africa who migrate to Iraq are subjected to forced labor as construction workers, security guards, cleaners, handymen, and domestic workers. Some foreign migrants are recruited for work in other countries in the region but are forced, coerced, or deceived into working in Iraq and the IKR. In January 2016, the MOLSA reported approximately 140,000 foreign workers lacked formal 235IRELANDwork permits; NGOs reported some employers and recruitment agents exploit workers' illegal status by withholding salaries and subjecting workers to substandard living conditions. The Kurdistan Independent Human Rights Commission reported in January 2016 that 69 percent of 480 foreign workers surveyed in the IKR had not been paid their agreed salaries and 18 percent reported violent acts committed against them by their employers. The Commission reported that it did not issue a report in 2017 due to the KRG budget crisis."},"Israel":{"April":2.0,"Asylum Seekers":"1","August":2.0,"December":3.0,"February":0.0,"Friday":3.0,"Global Population":8381.52,"January":0.0,"July":0.0,"June":1.0,"Life Expectancy":82.82,"March":0.0,"May":1.0,"Monday":2.0,"November":2.0,"October":2.0,"Population below $1.90 a day":"0.2","Saturday":2.0,"September":1.0,"Sunday":1.0,"Thursday":1.0,"Tuesday":3.0,"Violence against civilians":14,"Wednesday":2.0,"fatalities":["0","0","1","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","1"],"government_effort":"NA","introduction":"The Government of Israel fully meets the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking. The government continued to demonstrate serious and sustained efforts during the reporting period; therefore Israel remained on Tier 1. The government demonstrated serious and sustained efforts by improving victim identification procedures and identifying an increased number of victims. It continued to operate shelters and other facilities that provided victims a wide variety of immediate and long-term care and rehabilitative services, and it referred all identified victims to care. The government continued to prosecute and convict sex trafficking offenders, and it prosecuted an increased number of perpetrators in comparison to the previous reporting period. Although the government met the minimum standards, it convicted a significantly lower number of sex trafficking offenders than in the previous reporting period, and it continued to issue weak sentences that were inconsistent with the seriousness of the crime. It also did not prosecute or convict any forced labor perpetrators. Despite improvements to victim identification procedures, some victims referred by NGOs did not receive appropriate protection services. While the government identified and provided some care to trafficking victims among the irregular African migrant population, because of inadequate screening procedures it continued to punish victims among this population for crimes committed as a direct result of being subjected to trafficking, such as immigration violations. The government also implemented policies that subjected potential trafficking victims among this population to deportation.

Israeli forces shot one man dead and the other was injured and arrested. On Tuesday an imam was shot dead by unidentified gunmen as he was leaving prayers in Umm al Fahm.","prevention":"The government maintained strong efforts to prevent and raise awareness of human trafficking among the public and government officials. NATU continued to coordinate anti-trafficking efforts effectively among relevant ministries and NGOs during the reporting period, and NATU officials continued to appear regularly in the media to raise awareness of trafficking. NATU did not, however, complete a draft national action plan to combat trafficking that would replace the existing plan from 2007. The Knesset Subcommittee on Trafficking in Women and Prostitution met regularly and held 16 hearings and discussions during the reporting period. In 2017, the Ministry of Health funded a study conducted by a government-run health clinic and an NGO to study prostitution in the Eritrean migrant community. The government provided anti-trafficking training for its diplomatic personnel.In June 2017, the Knesset passed an amendment to the Foreign Workers Law to revoke an employer's license to employ a foreign worker if the employer was convicted of a severe crime, including human trafficking. The Ministry of Labor, Social Affairs, and Social Services, which employed 261 labor inspectors and contracted translators during routine inspections, issued 1,242 administrative warnings, imposed 45 fines, and processed one criminal complaint that resulted in a sentence of 100 hours of community service on employers for labor violations in 2017. Nonetheless, NGOs reported there were not enough labor inspectors, especially in the construction and agricultural sectors, to sufficiently monitor and enforce labor laws. Additionally, NGOs reported the government did not effectively regulate work force companies, nor combat criminal networks that recruited foreigners for the construction and caregiving fields and for prostitution. In April 2017, the government signed a bilateral agreement to allow 20,000 Chinese workers to enter Israel's construction sector; however, the agreement required workers to pay licensed employment recruiters up to $1,000 in recruitment fees and costs, which could increase their debt and vulnerability to forced labor. The government did not complete a plan to prevent exploitation of Thai workers from forced labor in the agricultural industry. In accordance with PIBA procedures for recruitment agencies in the caregiving sector, it continued to require every agency to hire a licensed social worker responsible for supervising the conditions of foreign caregivers, including home visits, and for informing relevant authorities about labor violations. The government, in collaboration with an NGO, continued to operate a 24-hour hotline to assist foreign workers who were in Israel under bilateral agreements. The hotline employed 11 interpreters in seven languages: Chinese, Thai, Bulgarian, Russian, Nepalese, Sinhalese, and Romanian. In 2017, the hotline received 1,398 calls, the majority from Thai agricultural workers. The government also maintained an emergency hotline for women and girls in prostitution, but it did not provide data on its operations in 2017. The government continued efforts to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts and to address sex tourism. In September 2017, the INP conducted an enforcement campaign on child sex trafficking, during which it conducted 19 raids on prostitution establishments, resulting in the arrests of two individuals and transfer of five children to social services. The government also temporarily shut down five brothels in 2017. In February 2018, the Ministry of Tourism led representatives of the Israeli tourism industry to sign the UN World Tourism Organization Code of Ethics, which included measures to prevent trafficking. ","prosecution":"The government maintained efforts to prosecute sex traffickers 238ISRAELbut it did not prosecute or convict any forced labor offenders; convicted sex traffickers continued to receive lenient sentences. The 2006 anti-trafficking law criminalized sex and labor trafficking and prescribed penalties of up to 16 years imprisonment for the trafficking of an adult, up to 20 years imprisonment for the trafficking of a child. These penalties were sufficiently stringent and, with respect to sex trafficking, commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. Inconsistent with the definition of trafficking under international law, the law did not establish the use of force, fraud, or coercion as an essential element of the crime. Under 376A of the Penal Law 5737-1977, holding a person's passport against their will carried a penalty of three to five years imprisonment.In 2017, police initiated 231 investigations of potential sex trafficking crimes, compared to 310 investigations in 2016. Police did not initiate any investigations for potential forced labor crimes. In 2017, the government initiated 10 prosecutions (four for adult sex trafficking crimes and six for child sex trafficking), but zero for forced labor; these numbers compared to three sex trafficking and zero forced labor prosecutions in 2016. In 2017, the government convicted three individuals (one for sex trafficking and two for child sex trafficking), but zero for forced labor; these numbers compared to 17 convictions in 2016 (16 for sex trafficking, including eight for child sex trafficking, and one for forced labor). In 2017, the prosecution unit within the Ministry of Interior's Population and Immigration Authority (PIBA) filed 143 criminal indictments against employers of foreign workers who violated labor laws that resulted in 114 sentences that included providing financial compensation to workers; however, none of these employers were prosecuted or convicted for potential forced labor crimes. In 2017, the government issued sentences for six sex trafficking offenders that ranged from community service to four to six years imprisonment, while one forced labor offender received a sentence of 15 months imprisonment. The government did not report any investigations, prosecutions, or convictions of government officials complicit in trafficking offenses.The government continued to provide extensive anti-trafficking training, awareness-raising workshops, and seminars to more than 320 officials. In addition, the government provided training to 130 police officers on child sex trafficking, and distributed materials on the offenses related to child sex trafficking to district investigation and intelligence officers and every police station in the country. ","protection":"The government increased protection efforts; however, it continued to punish identified and potential trafficking victims among the African migrant population for immigration violations, thereby preventing these victims from accessing appropriate protection services. The government continued to circulate trafficking victim identification guidelines widely to relevant ministries. Government officials referred more potential trafficking victims to the police during the reporting period, in comparison to previous years in which NGOs were the only source of victim referrals. The Israeli National Police (INP) granted official trafficking victim status to 73 individuals in 2017\u0160including 24 women and 49 men\u0160which was an increase from the 47 victims identified in 2016. The INP was the only government entity with authority to grant referred individuals official trafficking victim status, which also allowed a victim full access to protection services. During the majority of the reporting period, only one police officer in the country was authorized to interview and adjudicate applications for victim status, which led to significant delays. Recognizing this deficiency, in January 2018 the government appointed two full-time police officers to handle and process victim applications, with the intent of accelerating the process. In addition, during the reporting period, the National Anti-Trafficking Unit (NATU) coordinated with the INP to institute a fast-track procedure to more efficiently identify trafficking victims and eliminate a backlog of hundreds of applications for victim status. Nevertheless, an NGO reported that the INP's evidentiary standard for victim referrals from NGOs became stricter in 2017 by requiring witness testimony, thereby impeding efforts to officially recognize and provide at least 37 victims identified by an NGO with appropriate care. The government continued to provide a wide range of protective services for victims of all forms of trafficking. The government continued to operate a 35-bed shelter for female trafficking victims, a 35-bed shelter for male trafficking victims, and transitional apartments with 18 beds for female victims and six beds for male victims. Shelter residents were allowed to leave freely and, by law, all victims residing in the shelters were provided B1 visas\u0160unrestricted work visas. These shelters offered one year of rehabilitation services, including job training, psycho-social support, medical treatment, language training, and legal assistance. The INP referred all 73 identified victims to shelters, but some declined to enter a shelter and instead utilized rehabilitative services at a government-run day center. In 2017, the women's shelter assisted 41 victims, including four children; the men's shelter assisted 57 victims; and the transitional apartments assisted 24 men and women, including eight children. The majority of victims at the men's shelter were Ethiopian and Eritrean. The Ministry of Social Affairs continued to operate a day center in Tel Aviv for male and female trafficking victims who were either waiting for a space at a shelter or who chose not to reside at a shelter. The day center provided psycho-social services and food aid, and social workers at the center were trained to identify individuals at risk of trafficking and refer them to shelter services. In 2017, the center provided services to 256 men and women. The government also operated 12 centers for adult and child sex trafficking victims, which provided medical and rehabilitation services; the government assisted 350 individuals at these centers in 2017. Additionally, for identified trafficking victims who opted not to stay in shelters, the government continued to provide an official letter that protected them from potential arrest for immigration violations and emergency contact numbers for shelters and relevant ministries. Identified trafficking victims living outside of shelters were also entitled to receive one-year of free medical coverage at various government-funded health facilities. In 2017, the government provided medical care to 106 male and female trafficking victims. The Ministry of Justice Legal Aid Administration (LAA) continued to provide free legal aid to trafficking victims. In 2017, the branch received 202 legal aid requests to assist potential trafficking victims, including 125 irregular migrants who may have been subjected to trafficking in the Sinai. In 2017, the government issued 20 initial B1 visas and 19 extensions to sex and labor trafficking victims. It also issued 65 visas preventing the deportation of trafficking victims and 25 extensions of such visas in 2017. The government continued to encourage victims to assist in the investigation and prosecution of their traffickers, but did not require their participation as a condition for receiving visas and protective assistance; victims could also opt to leave the country pending trial proceedings. The government also allowed trafficking victims to work during 239ISRAELthe investigation and prosecution of their traffickers. The government forfeiture fund, which used property and money confiscated from traffickers to assist victims, disbursed 886,960 shekels ($255,530) to victims in 2017. The government published new guidelines in May 2017 discouraging the prosecution of forced labor victims for offenses committed during their exploitation; similar guidelines for sex trafficking victims were already in effect prior to the start of the reporting period. Nevertheless, the government continued to punish some trafficking victims\u0160specifically those among the irregular African migrant population, some of whom were exploited in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula\u0160as a direct result of being subjected to human trafficking. During the majority of the reporting period, the government lacked an effective process to identify or proactively screen for victims among this population, and as a result, authorities regularly detained or summoned to detention victims for immigration violations under the Law of Infiltration for one year without trial or conviction in the Holot facility and Saharonim and Giv'on prisons. Although the government characterized Holot as an open facility to detain \ufb01infiltrators,\ufb02 NGOs and Holot residents claimed it was a de facto detention center due to its remote location in the desert and restrictions on movement. In November 2017, PIBA implemented a revised questionnaire for officials to utilize to screen for trafficking among irregular migrants who were summoned to Holot. However, PIBA did not investigate claims that at least one trafficking victim remained at Holot after an NGO identified the victim in early 2017, nor did it attempt to release the victim. During the reporting period, the LAA gained the release of three men from Saharonim prison after INP identified them as trafficking victims; LAA also secured exemptions from detention in Holot for an additional 26 men after INP identified them as victims. LAA also requested that PIBA suspend the summons of three migrants to Holot while INP reviewed their applications for trafficking victim status. Both government and NGO officials reported that detention, threat of detention, or summoning to detention triggered severe post-traumatic stress symptoms\u0160including depression, fear, and eating disorders\u0160among migrants that experienced abuse, and in some cases trafficking, in the Sinai. In December 2017, the Knesset approved a plan to close Holot and deport all detained migrants, some of whom may be trafficking victims, to third countries; PIBA further issued regulations in January 2018 establishing procedures to implement this plan. ","recommendation":"Impose stricter sentences on convicted traffickers, consistent with the seriousness of the crime; proactively screen irregular migrants, particularly those who endured abuses in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, to ensure trafficking victims among this population are not penalized, including by detention and summoning to detention, for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being subjected to human trafficking; improve the process to officially recognize identified trafficking victims, including victims referred by NGOs, to allow for quicker access to protection services; increase methods of evaluating effectiveness of training for law enforcement, including police and prison officials, in victim identification, and enforcement of labor and sex trafficking laws; continue to provide protection for all trafficking victims, including shelter and medical and psycho-social treatment; increase and train the number of labor inspectors, social workers, and interpreters in the agricultural, construction, and caregiving sectors; negotiate full-scale bilateral labor agreements, to include protection mechanisms for workers, in the caregiving sector; and increase enforcement of foreign worker labor rights.","tier":"TIER 1","traffick_profile":"As reported over the past five years, Israel is a destination country for men and women subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking, as well as a source country for men, women, and to a lesser extent children, subjected to sex trafficking within Israel. Foreign workers, primarily from South and Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe, and the Palestinian territories migrate to Israel for temporary work in construction, agriculture, and caregiving; some of these workers are subjected to forced labor. As of January 2018, the Israeli government reported there were 88,171 legal foreign workers and 18,059 illegal foreign workers, including Palestinian workers, in Israel. Foreign workers in the construction sector suffer from labor rights abuses and violations, some of which may be trafficking. Some employers in the construction sector illegally charge Palestinian workers monthly commissions and fees, and in many cases employers illegally hire out Palestinian workers to other workplaces; these workers are vulnerable to forced labor. Some Thai men and women are subjected to forced labor in Israel's agricultural sector and face conditions of long working hours, no breaks or rest 240ITALYdays, withheld passports, and difficulty changing employers due to limitations on work permits. Caregivers are highly vulnerable to forced labor due to their isolation inside private residences and their lack of protection under the labor law; local NGOs report that caregivers are subjected to excessive recruitment fees, fraudulent work contracts, long work hours, confiscation of passports, underpayment of wages, physical violence, sexual harassment and abuse, denial of severance pay, and poor housing including\u0160in some cases\u0160living in the same room as their employer. According to the Israeli government, as of June 2017 there were 49,100 foreign caregivers in Israel, 80 percent of whom are women; these caregivers constituted 57 percent of all legal foreign workers in the country. Networks of workforce agencies recruit Ukrainian and Georgian workers to Israel through a fraudulent asylum-claim process and charge workers high mediation fees and sell them fake documents; these workers are vulnerable to exploitation. Eritrean and Sudanese male and female migrants are highly vulnerable to sex and labor trafficking in Israel. According to an international organization, as of September 2017, 72 percent of the 38,000 irregular migrants in Israel are Eritrean and 20 percent are Sudanese. According to NGOs, these migrants and asylum-seekers became increasingly vulnerable to trafficking following the government's implementation of a policy in May 2017 that reduced net wages for this population. Economic distress among women in this population greatly increases their vulnerability to sexual exploitation. Since 2007, thousands of African migrants entered Israel via the Sinai Peninsula. The ftow of these migrants arriving in Israel, peaking at more than 17,000 in 2011, has dramatically decreased to zero in 2017. Many of these migrants were kidnapped in the Sinai and subjected to severe abuse, including forced labor and sex trafficking, at the hands of criminal groups in the Sinai before reaching Israel. Women from Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, China, and Ghana, as well as Eritrean men and women, are subjected to sex trafficking in Israel; some women arrive on tourist visas to work willingly in prostitution\u0160particularly in the southern coastal resort city of Eilat, but are subsequently exploited by sex traffickers. Some traffickers reportedly recruit sex trafficking victims with false, fraudulent, or misleading job offers on the internet, sometimes through legitimate employment websites. NGOs report some Palestinian LGBTI persons in Israel are vulnerable to abuse and exploitation, due to their legal status and restrictions on work eligibility for Palestinian nationals in Israel. Israeli transgender persons are also highly vulnerable to sex trafficking. Some transgender persons are sexually exploited in prostitution in order to be able to afford gender-affirming care. Some transgender children as young as 13 years old, some of whom run away from home, are exploited in sex trafficking."},"Jordan":{"April":0.0,"Asylum Seekers":"3","August":0.0,"December":0.0,"February":0.0,"Friday":2.0,"Global Population":9965.32,"January":0.0,"July":0.0,"June":1.0,"Life Expectancy":74.4,"March":0.0,"May":0.0,"Monday":0.0,"November":1.0,"October":1.0,"Population below $1.90 a day":"0.1","Saturday":0.0,"September":0.0,"Sunday":0.0,"Thursday":0.0,"Tuesday":1.0,"Violence against civilians":3,"Wednesday":0.0,"fatalities":["0","1","1"],"government_effort":"NA","introduction":"The Government of Jordan does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. The government demonstrated increasing efforts compared to the previous reporting period; therefore Jordan remained on Tier 2. The government demonstrated increasing efforts by identifying and providing care to an increased number of victims and demonstrated strong efforts to investigate, prosecute, and convict traffickers. It also continued to improve the standard operating procedures (SOPs) within the national victim referral mechanism for authorities to systematically identify and refer victims to protection services. However, the government did not meet the minimum standards in several key areas. Under Jordan's anti-trafficking law, penalties for sex trafficking offenses were 248JORDANnot commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious crimes. Jordanian authorities did not enact draft amendments to the anti-trafficking law, and a lack of sufficient resources hindered victim identification and care.

The man who was allegedly kidnapped was later arrested by Jordanian police for staging his abduction. On Oct 23, the former head of counterterrorism in Jordan was murdered by a gunman in front of his house in Madaba. Police have not released more information on the identity of the shooter. On June 8th, reports were released that a man held at a police station in Amman had been tortured to death. The victim's family confirmed reports while the state-run new agency said the man had hit his head and was taken to the hospital but died immediately. 5 police officers were arrested following a probe by the Public Security director.","prevention":" The government maintained strong prevention efforts. The inter-ministerial anti-trafficking committee met regularly during the reporting period. The government continued to draft a new national anti-trafficking action plan and strategy, but it was not finalized by the end of the reporting period. The government continued to raise awareness about trafficking crimes. Authorities continued to distribute anti-trafficking brochures to all foreign migrant workers entering Jordan, and labor inspectors distributed brochures in multiple languages at inspected work sites. MOL continued to operate a hotline to receive labor complaints, which offered interpretation services in some source-country languages. However, due to overall budget shortfalls, the government was unable to consistently maintain interpreters of some Asian languages at the hotline, which led to difficulties identifying potential trafficking victims and referring them to protection services. The government continued to take efforts to reduce the demand for forced labor and commercial sex acts. In 2017, the government improved measures to reduce the vulnerability of Syrian refugees to trafficking. The government continued to make efforts to address and prevent forced marriages among the Syrian refugee population, which put women and girls at risk of abuse and exploitation. The government continued to issue work permits to Syrian refugees during the reporting period; in 2017, it issued 46,717 work permits to Syrians. The government also remained committed to formalizing access to the labor market for 200,000 Syrians from host communities and refugee camps. For example in August 2017, the government began issuing a new type of ftexible work permit to Syrians in the construction sector, which it estimated would benefit at least 20,000 laborers; the permit legalized the status of these workers in the sector and allowed Syrians to work for multiple construction sector employers in a 12-month period. In 2017, the Ministry of Education (MOE) increased Syrian refugees' access to public education by doubling the number of schools that could accommodate an additional 50,000 Syrian refugee children. The MOE also established an accelerated educational program for Syrian refugee students who had not been in the formal school system for the last three or more years. The MOL reduced the total number of labor inspectors from 237 in 2016 to 200 in 2017; inspectors were responsible for enforcing the labor code, including inspecting child labor violations across the country. In 2017, MOL conducted 79,589 labor inspections in the formal and informal sectors. In 2017, it also conducted 6,337 inspections focused on child labor, opened 420 child labor cases, and issued 328 warnings to employers for child labor violations. The government continued to conduct labor inspections in the agricultural sector in 2017, but found no labor violations or potential trafficking crimes; 250KAZAKHSTANnevertheless, MOL officials continued to report that there was not a clear regulatory framework for inspections of this sector, while it also lacked sufficient resources to monitor this sector. The MOL reported 36 instances of labor violations committed by recruitment centers in 2017. In 2017, the MOL implemented new regulations that required labor recruitment companies to maintain insurance policies for workers, which provided repatriation costs, health care, and death benefits. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs continued to report its finance department directly paid locally-hired domestic staff of Jordanian diplomats posted abroad, in accordance with labor laws and wage rates in the host country. The government did not provide specific anti-trafficking training for its diplomatic personnel, nor troops or police before their deployment abroad as peacekeepers. ","prosecution":" The government maintained strong anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts. The 2009 anti-human trafficking law criminalized sex and labor trafficking. The law prescribed penalties of a minimum of six months imprisonment andor a fine for sex and labor trafficking involving adult victims. These penalties were sufficiently stringent. However, by allowing for a fine in lieu of imprisonment, the penalties prescribed for sex trafficking were not commensurate with the penalties prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. The law prescribed penalties of up to 10 years imprisonment and a fine for the sex trafficking and forced labor of children, as well as for the sex trafficking of adults and other forms of adult trafficking involving aggravating circumstances. These penalties were sufficiently stringent and, with respect to sex trafficking, commensurate with those prescribed for other grave crimes, such as rape. Jordan's passport law criminalized the withholding of passports by an employer, carrying penalties of six months to three years imprisonment and fines. During the reporting period, the government did not pass draft amendments to the anti-trafficking law that would enhance sentences for trafficking offenses and establish a victims' compensation fund, in part because the Minister of Finance rejected funding the victims' fund through the national budget. The Public Security Directorate (PSD) and Ministry of Labor (MOL) joint anti-trafficking unit\u0160the national focal point leading anti-trafficking investigations\u0160continued to investigate potential trafficking crimes. The unit had national jurisdiction and included 18 criminal investigators, three labor inspectors, as well as interpreters and researchers. In 2017, the anti-trafficking unit investigated 310 potential trafficking cases. Additionally, in 2017 labor inspectors gained access to the residences provided for foreign garment workers to investigate potential labor violations and potential trafficking crimes. NGOs reported labor inspectors did not adequately investigate potential trafficking crimes (or other labor violations) in the agricultural sector. The Ministry of Justice reported it initiated the prosecution of 52 trafficking cases in 2017 and continued prosecution of additional trafficking cases initiated in previous years. The government convicted 10 traffickers under the anti-trafficking law, while 33 perpetrators were either acquitted or convicted of other crimes or violations of the labor law. Traffickers convicted in 2017 received sentences ranging from a fine of 1,000 Jordanian dinar ($1,410) to five years imprisonment with temporary hard labor and a fine of 5,000 Jordanian dinar ($7,060); some of these sentences were not sufficiently stringent to deter the crime. Efforts in 2017 were on par with the 58 total prosecutions and 10 convictions in 2016. Nevertheless, legal experts suggested courts were hesitant to convict perpetrators for human trafficking, preferring to pursue other charges such as labor violations that carried lesser penalties than the anti-trafficking law. NGOs and foreign embassy representatives continued to report the government preferred to settle potential cases of domestic servitude through mediation, rather than referring them for criminal prosecution. NGOs also raised concerns that the long litigation process for trafficking cases gave employers time to pressure victims to drop their cases. The government did not report any investigations, prosecutions, or convictions of government officials complicit in trafficking offenses during the reporting period. The anti-trafficking unit continued to place specially trained officials in cities outside the capital, including Aqaba, Irbid, and Ramtha. Resources were primarily concentrated in Amman, Jordan's capital and largest city. Jordan's overcrowded and underfunded judicial system reduced the availability of trained judges and prosecutors who could specialize in trafficking cases. However, during the reporting period, the anti-trafficking unit reported conducting several anti-trafficking training workshops for officials, in coordination with international organizations and NGOs. The government also provided training to 51 labor inspectors around the country on victim identification, victim protection, and trafficking prosecutions. ","protection":" The government increased efforts to protect victims; however, some victims remained vulnerable to punishment. The government continued to utilize formal written procedures to guide officials in identifying trafficking victims, and it continued to receive referrals of potential trafficking victims from NGOs, an international organization, and police stations in Amman. In 2017, the anti-trafficking unit identified 75 trafficking victims, which was an increase from the 65 victims the government identified in 2016. The government continued to utilize formal written procedures to refer identified victims to care; however, civil society organizations reported that labor inspectors, police, 249JORDANand detention center officials lacked the specialized training to proactively identify and refer victims to protection services. The PSD continued to work in cooperation with a local NGO to identify and assist victims at police stations and prison rehabilitation centers, as well as to train PSD personnel and assist in the repatriation of victims. Government and NGO officials noted some field officers and inspectors were not well-informed of the SOPs within the existing victim referral mechanism to refer victims to care. To address these deficiencies, the government continued to work with an international organization to develop more detailed victim referral procedures to better guide officials; the revised procedures were pending approval at the end of the reporting period. The Ministry of Social Development (MOSD) continued to operate and provide assistance to victims at a shelter solely dedicated to protecting trafficking victims, which provided a wide range of services, including psycho-social care, medical treatment, legal assistance, vocational training, and specialized services for children. The shelter's staff included specialists in psychology, social work, nursing, and education. The facility had the capacity to serve 40 male and female victims, both citizens and foreign nationals, including children, with a separate wing and entrance for male victims; it was the only shelter in the country available for men. The provision of shelter services was not conditional upon a victim's cooperation with law enforcement or judicial authorities. During the reporting period, shelter staff also coordinated with the MOL to waive fees for victims' lapsed labor permits and assisted victims to find new employment if they chose to continue working. The government allocated an operating budget for the shelter through 2018; it did not report budgeting information beyond 2018. In 2017, the shelter served a total of 99 trafficking victims, the majority of whom were female victims of forced labor, domestic servitude, or sexual exploitation; this represented an increase from 56 victims assisted at the shelter in 2016. The anti-trafficking unit referred the majority of the victims to the shelter, but NGOs and foreign embassies also referred some victims. The MOSD, through the trafficking shelter, was responsible for coordinating with NGOs and foreign embassies to assist in the repatriation of foreign trafficking victims, but it did not provide such assistance during the reporting period. Other facilities that served female victims of gender-based violence also served potential trafficking victims. Victims were not able to file civil suits against their traffickers for restitution. However, the government encouraged victims to assist in the prosecution of their traffickers by providing legal and reintegration assistance; victims also had the option to provide a deposition prior to being repatriated. The government provided foreign victims with legal alternatives to their removal to countries where they faced retribution or hardship. Despite the government's victim identification and protection efforts, some foreign trafficking victims remained vulnerable to financial penalties, arrest, detention, and deportation if found without valid residence documents. Jordan's sponsorship system prevents foreign workers from switching employers (without a letter of release from their sponsor) or receiving adequate access to legal recourse in response to abuse. Migrant workers, including potential trafficking victims, who left their place of employment prior to fulfilling their work contract, were considered illegal residents and accrued fines for their illegal presence in the country and risked detention. According to an NGO, even if a worker left an employer because it was an exploitative situation, bureaucratic and financial barriers and detention prevented some victims from repatriation. Furthermore, trafficking victims who opted to remain in Jordan for work were required to pay their overstay and lapsed labor permit fines before applying for a new work permit, which was a significant financial burden for victims. Some foreign workers remained in Jordanian detention, due to pending criminal charges against them or their inability to pay overstay penalties or plane fare home. In April 2017, the media reported the government initiated a crackdown on domestic workers who fted their employers\u0160a population highly vulnerable to trafficking\u0160and violated the labor law and residency regulations, which resulted in the arrest and deportation of 11 foreign domestic workers; the government did not report utilizing identification measures to screen for potential trafficking victims during this crackdown. ","recommendation":"Amend the anti-trafficking law to ensure penalties for sex trafficking crimes are commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes; ensure victims are not inappropriately punished for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being subjected to trafficking, such as immigration or prostitution violations or escaping from an abusive employer; significantly increase training for law enforcement, prison officials, and labor inspectors throughout the country to proactively screen for, identify, and refer to protection services trafficking victims among vulnerable populations, such as detained foreign migrants, domestic workers, workers in the agricultural sector, and women in prostitution; fully implement the national victim referral mechanism, and finalize and distribute to all relevant officials the revised SOPs for the mechanism; continue to prosecute, convict, and punish sex trafficking and forced labor offenses with adequate jail time, and investigate and punish individuals for withholding workers' passports under Jordan's passport law; continue to regularly cooperate with NGOs to identify and refer victims to protection services; continue to allocate adequate funding for operation of the government's trafficking shelter, and train shelter staff to identify and provide specialized care to victims; issue (or apply) labor regulations governing work in the agricultural sector, and increase labor inspections in this sector; and regulate and investigate fraudulent labor and recruitment practices. ","tier":"TIER 2","traffick_profile":"As reported over the past five years, Jordan is a source, transit, and destination country for adults and children subjected to forced labor, domestic servitude, and sex trafficking. Trafficking victims in Jordan are primarily from South and Southeast Asia, East Africa, Egypt, and Syria. Forced labor victims in Jordan experience withheld or non-payment of wages, confiscation of identity documents, restricted freedom of movement, unsafe living conditions, long hours without rest, isolation, and verbal and physical abuse. Jordan relies on foreign migrant workers\u0160many of whom are undocumented\u0160in several sectors, including construction, agriculture, textiles, and domestic work. According to an NGO in 2017, domestic and agricultural workers in Jordan are the most vulnerable to trafficking because of informal work agreements and frequently changing employers. Some migrant workers from Egypt\u0160the largest source of foreign labor in Jordan\u0160experience forced labor in the construction, service, and agricultural sectors. In 2015, the government estimated there were 53,000 foreign female domestic workers in Jordan, primarily from Southeast Asia and East Africa. Men and women from throughout Asia migrate to work in factories in Jordan's garment industry, some of whom may be vulnerable to trafficking. As of 2017, instances of workers paying unauthorized recruitment fees to labor recruiting agents in their country of origin reportedly declined. Refugees from Syria, the Palestinian Territories, and Iraq are highly vulnerable to trafficking in Jordan. Syrian boys and young men\u0160in particular\u0160often work illegally and informally in the Jordanian economy, which puts them at risk of trafficking. NGOs have observed an increase in child labor and potential forced child labor among Syrian refugee children working alongside their families in the agricultural and service industries, as well as peddling goods and begging. Because the agricultural sector in Jordan is inadequately regulated, children working in this sector may be susceptible to exploitation. There have been reported cases of Syrian refugee women and girls sold into forced marriages. Some Syrian and Jordanian girls are forced to drop out of compulsory school to perform domestic service in their families' homes; some of these girls are vulnerable to trafficking. Jordanian children employed within the country as mechanics, agricultural laborers, and beggars may be victims of forced labor. Lebanese, North African, and Eastern European women may be forced into prostitution after migrating to Jordan to work in restaurants and nightclubs; some Jordanian women working in nightclubs may also be forced into prostitution. As reported by an NGO in 2016, some Egyptian women are forced to beg or forced into prostitution by their Jordanian husbands. Some out-of-status domestic workers from Indonesia, the Philippines, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka have been reportedly forced into prostitution after fteeing their employers."},"Kazakhstan":{"April":1.0,"Asylum Seekers":"4","August":0.0,"December":1.0,"February":0.0,"Friday":1.0,"Global Population":18319.62,"January":1.0,"July":0.0,"June":1.0,"Life Expectancy":73.24,"March":2.0,"May":0.0,"Monday":0.0,"November":2.0,"October":1.0,"Population below $1.90 a day":"0","Saturday":1.0,"September":0.0,"Sunday":2.0,"Thursday":1.0,"Tuesday":1.0,"Violence against civilians":9,"Wednesday":3.0,"fatalities":["0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0"],"government_effort":"NA","introduction":"The Government of Kazakhstan does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so.

However, the government did not meet the minimum standards in several key areas. Efforts to identify and protect foreign victims remained inadequate. Foreign victims could receive comprehensive assistance if they participated in criminal investigations; victims who chose not to participate in these proceedings were ineligible for services and had no legal alternatives to removal. NGOs continued to report allegations of police officers' complicity in human trafficking. While the government convicted two police officers complicit in trafficking crimes, there remained few investigations or prosecutions of police or other government officials suspected of complicity.

On 30 October, two civilians claimed being beaten by three police officers in Karaganda after being stopped by the traffic police. The police reported that the civilians were stopped for being intoxicated and for insulting law enforcement officers. [coded to the version of the civilian] On 23 June, a visually impaired man sitting in a park in Kostanay was detained, beaten and choked by the police, resulting in severe facial injuries and hospitalization. The man claimed he was detained arbitrarily, however, the court sentenced him to three days in jail for staging a protest on the grounds that he was wearing a blue t-shirt - the color of the opposition party. Authorities have been known to detain several people for wearing blue colors. A video of the incident was widely spread on social media. In the night of 5-6 April, a bus with Kyrgyz number plates was shot at in Aktobe region. The bus driver was injured. On 23 March and later, suicide attempts of convicts of a detention facility in Almaty region were noticed, after the detainees reportedly became subjects of torture and their complaints were ignored. The issue was published and reported by human rights activist to the attorney-general alongside with evidence (photos). On 11 March, a prisoner was tortured to death by prison guards in a prison near Dolinka, Karaganda region.

According to a report by human rights activists, the women (one pregnant) were beaten and bullied. The women also started a hunger strike.","prevention":"The government maintained prevention efforts, under the direction of the Interagency Trafficking in Persons Working Group, led by the Ministry of Health and Social Protection. During the reporting period, the government adopted a new Concept of Migration policy for 2017-2021 and an associated Action Plan. This policy addressed internal and external migration challenges, particularly the status of Kazakhstan as a destination country. The government completed implementation of the national action plan for 2015-2017, which included activities to improve anti-trafficking legislation; investigation and prosecution of human trafficking cases; victim identification and assistance; cooperation with international and NGOs; and prevention efforts such as public awareness programs. The government developed an anti-trafficking national action plan for 2018-2020, but did not formally adopt it during the reporting period. The government continued to fund anti-trafficking information and education campaigns targeting potential trafficking victims, including children. The Ministry of Information and Communication funded radio and television programs, as well as the publication of newspaper articles and web-publications, designed to raise public awareness and prevent the crime. In July 2017, the MVD began a second annual public information campaign in commemoration of International Day against Human Trafficking. During the campaign, police participated in television and radio programs, conducted presentations at hospitals and tourist information and construction offices, and organized ftash mobs at sporting events to raise public awareness of human trafficking. The MVD also distributed information in parks, shopping malls, rail stations, airports, hotels, and markets that included the number for the national anti-trafficking hotline. The hotline received more than 1,325 calls in 2017, which led to the investigation of 13 cases of human trafficking. In 2017, labor inspectors under the Ministry of Health and Social Protection conducted 8,393 inspections to identify labor violations, which resulted in 2,335 recruiters and employers receiving administrative fines for violations of foreign labor recruitment rules and employment of undocumented foreign laborers and the opening of 158 criminal cases by the MVD. NGOs reported receiving an estimated 10.5 million tenge ($31,690) from the government for prevention projects, including public awareness campaigns. The government did not take any action to reduce the demand for commercial sex or forced labor. The government did not provide anti-trafficking training to its diplomatic personnel.","prosecution":"The government decreased anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts. Articles 128, 134, 135, and 308 of the penal code criminalized all forms of trafficking. However, inconsistent with the definition of trafficking under international law, the law did not include force, fraud, or coercion as an essential element of the crime, but rather considered it an aggravated circumstance. 251KAZAKHSTANThe law prescribed penalties of three to five years imprisonment for adult trafficking and five to seven years imprisonment for child trafficking; the penalties could be increased to up to 15 years imprisonment under aggravated circumstances. These penalties were sufficiently stringent and, with respect to sex trafficking, commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. Article 68 of the criminal code allowed defendants to pursue settlements by paying monetary compensation to the victim in exchange for having the criminal case withdrawn; while this option was not available in cases involving sex crimes against minors, it was an option in cases involving other forms of trafficking under article 128, part 1; in 2017, this article was not applied in any trafficking cases.Police investigated 101 trafficking cases in 2017, compared to 147 in 2016. The government did not report the number of prosecutions. The government convicted 29 offenders, compared to 45 in 2016; of which, 20 sex traffickers received sentences ranging from two and a half years conditional sentence to seven years imprisonment and eight labor traffickers received sentences of three years and six months to 10 years; one trafficker received a six years and eight months sentence for forced criminality. In addition, the government opened 200 investigations of trafficking-related crimes, including pimping and brothel maintenance. NGOs continued to report traffickers bribed low-ranking police officials to avoid these charges, and alleged that some police officers facilitated forced labor or sex trafficking crimes. In June 2017, the government sentenced the former head of the Aktobe state-run railway station to five years and six months in prison for labor exploitation of three individuals. In June 2017, a local police officer in Aktobe was sentenced to three years in prison for the extortion of a sauna owner for the purposes of commercial sex. The government maintained its efforts on training police, prosecutors, and judges in the identification, investigation, and prosecution of trafficking crimes and funded police participation in international anti-trafficking conferences. In 2017, the Judicial Academy conducted five training sessions for 183 judges on the protection of trafficking victims during the criminal process. The Ministry of Internal Affairs' (MVD) Trafficking in Persons Training Center conducted eight training sessions on investigative techniques for 143 police officers. An estimated 174 police officers participated jointly with social workers in training events on victim assistance. In all training programs, the government provided the venue while international organizations, NGOs, and international donors covered other costs, including the travel of trainers and provision of training materials. During the reporting period, the government jointly investigated 14 cases related to trafficking in cooperation with foreign governments, including Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, and Uzbekistan. In 2017, the government extradited two foreign citizens wanted in their home countries for trafficking-related crimes. ","protection":"The government increased protection efforts for Kazakhstani victims, but made uneven protection efforts for foreign victims. While it improved the availability of protection services for Kazakhstani victims, efforts to identify and assist foreign victims remained negligible, with no shelters available to foreign victims. The government identified 76 trafficking victims, a decrease from 110 in 2016. Of those, 50 were victims of sex trafficking, 20 of forced labor, and six of forced criminality. All but five of the identified victims were from Kazakhstan; of five foreign victims, four were from Uzbekistan and one from Georgia; five of the Kazakhstani victims were subjected to trafficking in Brazil, four in Bahrain, and three each in Turkey and South Korea, while the rest were subjected to trafficking in Kazakhstan, recruited from rural to urban areas for both labor and sexual exploitation. All 71 Kazakhstani victims identified by the government received assistance from government-funded programs; however, foreign victims were not eligible for assistance in government-funded shelters. In 2017, NGOs reported assisting 177 trafficking victims, compared to 167 in 2016; among these, police referred 22 while 155 referrals came from international organizations, embassies, NGOs, and the victims themselves. Of the 177 trafficking victims assisted by NGOs, 39 were Kazakhstani and 138 were foreigners; 13 were victims of sex trafficking, 158 of forced labor; 36 were female, and 141 male. Of the 138 foreign victims, 131 were from Uzbekistan. The government-funded and NGO-operated trafficking hotline received 1,350 phone calls in 2017, the vast majority of which were requests for information while 13 were referred to anti-trafficking police units; these referrals resulted in six confirmed cases of labor exploitation. Observers noted many foreign victims were reluctant to self-identify to the police due to lack of trust, perceived corruption, and fear of punishment or deportation due to their unlawful status, among other reasons. In cases where law enforcement identified foreign victims, victims often refused to cooperate. According to experts, foreign victims report to local police upon return to their home country, where they feel safer.In addition to four existing government-funded, NGO-operated shelters, in 2017 the government opened trafficking shelters in seven cities: Almaty, Temirtau, Petropavlovsk, Uralsk, Aktobe, Kyzylorda, and Taldykorgan. The 11 NGO-operated trafficking shelters offered legal, psychological, and medical assistance and were accessible to all Kazakhstani trafficking victims, regardless of gender or age. Shelter services were not conditional upon victim's cooperation with law enforcement. Foreign citizens were not eligible to receive services at these shelters. In 2017, the government allocated at least 162.7 million Kazakhstani Tenge (KZT) ($491,080) to direct victim assistance, including 159 million KZT ($479,910) for shelter assistance and 3.7 million KZT ($11,170) for victim assistance during investigations, an increase from 25.97 million KZT ($78,390) in 2016. The shelters were opened and staffed in accordance with the 2016 established standards for trafficking victim shelters. In 2017, a law on victim compensation was adopted, which allowed victims, including foreign victims to request monetary compensation as a part of the criminal proceedings, instead of filing a civil suit in conjunction with the criminal case; the law was scheduled to be implemented in 2020. NGOs reported effective victim referral and police cooperation with anti-trafficking units assigned to each region. Law enforcement units mandated to address migration or trafficking issues have a formal system to identify trafficking victims among at-risk persons, such as undocumented migrants or persons in prostitution; nonetheless, officials' efforts to identify foreign victims were limited. The government encouraged victims\u0160including foreigners\u0160to participate in investigations and prosecutions by providing witness protection during court proceedings, access to pre-trial shelter services, and basic provisions such as food, clothing, and medical and legal assistance. However, if a criminal case was not initiated, authorities did not recognize or give protective status to foreign victims. In 2017, the government provided two foreign victims legal protection (compared to 15 foreign victims in 2016), including suspension of deportation proceedings, and special temporary residency throughout the criminal investigation. 252KENYANGOs reported foreign victims sometimes experienced problems in accessing local medical care due to a lack of health insurance or residence permits. The government did not offer legal alternatives to foreign victims' removal to countries where they would face retribution or hardship and, according to local law, victims were deported after expiration of their temporary residency rights. In 2017, there were no reports of authorities criminally punishing victims for crimes as a direct result of being subjected to trafficking; however, authorities routinely detained and deported possible foreign victims with no proactive efforts made to screen for trafficking victimization, offer referral to care providers, or ensure they were not penalized for crimes committed as a result of their trafficking.","recommendation":"Significantly increase efforts to identify trafficking victims\u0160particularly foreign forced labor victims\u0160among vulnerable populations and refer these victims for assistance; significantly increase assistance for foreign trafficking victims and ensure victim identification and assistance are not contingent on participation in investigation and prosecution efforts; vigorously investigate, prosecute, and convict suspected trafficking cases, respecting due process, including allegedly complicit government officials and police officers; increase funding and resources for anti-trafficking police units; amend laws to remove the option for traffickers to avoid criminal liability through \ufb01conciliation of parties,\ufb02 or otherwise ensure such crimes are subject to criminal investigation and prosecution; cease deporting victims and provide legal alternatives to forced repatriation; continue to train labor inspectors to identify victims of forced labor and report potential trafficking cases to the police; and provide anti-trafficking training or guidance for diplomatic personnel to prevent their engagement in or facilitation of trafficking crimes.","tier":"TIER 2","traffick_profile":"As reported over the past five years, Kazakhstan is a destination and, to a lesser extent, a source and transit country for men, women, and children subjected to sex trafficking and forced labor. Domestic trafficking remains a consistent problem, as victims are lured from rural areas to larger cities with mala fide offers of employment. Kazakhstani men and women are subjected to forced labor mostly in Russia, but also in Bahrain, Brazil, the Republic of Korea, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates. Kazakhstani women and girls are subjected to sex trafficking in the Middle East, Europe, East Asia, and the United States. Women and girls from neighboring Central Asian and Eastern European countries, as well as from rural areas in Kazakhstan, are subjected to sex trafficking in Kazakhstan; in most cases, traffickers target young girls and women, luring them with promises of employment as waitresses, models, or nannies in large cities. Some children are forced to beg. Adults and children may be coerced into criminal behavior. The relative economic prosperity in the government capital Astana, the financial capital Almaty, and the western oil cities Aktau and Atyrau, attract large numbers of Kazakhstanis from rural villages, some of whom become victims of labor trafficking and sex trafficking. Chinese, Filipino, Ukrainian, Kazakhstani, and other Central Asian citizens, in particular Uzbekistani men and women, are subjected to forced labor in domestic service, construction, and agriculture in Kazakhstan. Since Russia banned re-entry for an estimated one million Uzbek migrants, many of them have sought temporary work and residence in Kazakhstan, where they remained vulnerable to trafficking; since 2014, the year the ban entered into effect, NGOs have identified more than 100 foreign victims each year, likely only a portion of the overall victims in this migrant population. Many victims of trafficking in Kazakhstan indicate they were lured through fraud and deceit, sometimes by friends or acquaintances, and, at times, exploited by small organized criminal groups in Kazakhstan. Traffickers capitalize on tough law enforcement policies to coerce migrants to remain in exploitative situations and leverage these policies to threaten victims with punishment and deportation if they notify authorities, fostering distrust in law enforcement.

The government demonstrated increasing efforts compared to the previous reporting period; therefore Kenya remained on Tier 2. The government demonstrated increasing efforts by commencing digital law enforcement data tracking on a monthly basis, fully implementing its national referral mechanism, and vetting 45 recruitment agencies in compliance with registration requirements and a code of conduct. In addition, officials allocated funding for its victim assistance fund for the first time since 2015. Labor attaches to Kenyan missions in Qatar, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Saudi Arabia became fully operational to protect citizens employed in those countries. However, the government did not meet the minimum standards in several key areas. Kenyan authorities continued to treat some victims as criminals, and the availability of protective services for adult victims remained negligible. There were no investigations into official complicity despite credible reports of traffickers obtaining fraudulent identity documents from corrupt officials. The government also routinely tried trafficking crimes as immigration or labor law violations rather than under the anti-trafficking law, which resulted in traffickers receiving less stringent sentences.253KENYA","iso3":"KEN","latitude":["0.2386","-1.3117","-0.5833","3.9357","0.0667","-1.1667","3.0021","2.3833","0.99","4.354","-0.11800000000000001","3.28","-4.0839","-4.0333","-1.1833","1.2693","-3.1305","1.2389","-0.0371","1.2667","0.8378","0.4919","0.8378","-1.6947","-0.7202","-3.0333","0.5333","0.1833","0.4599","-1.25","1.1692","-0.1","1.4845","3.1508","-0.1282","-0.4167","-0.5083","-0.5273","3.9357","2.6106","1.9516","-1.4333","1.2972","-1.25","-1.2437","-1.25","2.9833","-0.1161","-1.25","-1.2830000000000001","-0.1161","-0.8167","-1.2830000000000001","0.1907","-1.5952","-0.3895","-0.3895","-0.6833","-4.2875","2.8094","-1.25","2.4094","-4.05","-0.5083","-1.0783","-3.9758","-0.9","-0.6","-0.391","-1.0667","-1.5394","-1.2326","-0.3072","-0.7833","-1.2785","2.8094","0.2064","0.2064","0.2064","0.2064","0.6752","1.2972","-3.4929","4.2667","-1.2407","4.4747","1.0667","2.1291","2.0053","2.0780000000000003","2.1014","-1.2830000000000001","1.2972","0.4667","3.9357","-0.75","1.6","0.1167","0.3833","1.6","-4.2875","3.9439","-1.2830000000000001","-1.2830000000000001","-0.7333","1.7828","0.05","0.5333","2.6465","0.8099","1.75","1.75","-0.4167","-1.2830000000000001","1.3077","1.2167","-2.2717","-0.5666"],"location":["Bondo","Kibera","Siakago","Mandera","Rambara","Kiambu","Kapelbok","Lokichar","Elegeyo-Marakwet","Kaakong","Banita","Gambela","Likoni","Kisauni","Thimbigua","Kipchumwa","Chakama","Kapenguria","Chemase","Endo","Bartabwa","Kabarnet","Bartabwa","Masalani","Naivasha","Magarini","Garba Tula","Bushiangala","Ol Moran","Dandora","Kapedo","Kisumu","Sigor","Lafey","Kathwana","Nyeri","Mauche","Homa Bay","Mandera","Daba Siti","Lokori","Kiini","Tiati","Dandora","Kuria East","Dandora","Kerio","Nyamasaria","Dandora","Nairobi","Nyamasaria","Kigumo","Nairobi","Irobo","Ijara","Nessuit","Nessuit","Kisii","Ukunda","El Wak","Dandora","Kotulo","Mombasa","Mauche","Narok","Utange","Nkoben","Mau Narok","Sondu","Migori","Boni National Reserve","Gigiri","Nakuru","Bomet","Kileleshwa","El Wak","Butere","Butere","Butere","Butere","Soy","Tiati","Ganze","Lowerangak","Kariobangi","Olgana","Endebess","Lagh Kutulo","Konton","Qarsa","Boji Garass","Nairobi","Tiati","Marigat","Mandera","Mwea","Laisamis","Sirisia","Matungu","Laisamis","Ukunda","Banissa","Nairobi","Nairobi","Ndhiwa","Nachola","Meru","Garba Tula","Malkagufu","Cheptais","Wajir","Wajir","Nyeri","Nairobi","Chepareria","Embobut","Lamu","Nyamira"],"longitude":["34.2694","36.7891","37.6333","41.8542","34.7","36.8333","35.5322","35.65","35.55","35.524","36.0756","39.37","39.6616","39.6833","36.7667","35.5557","39.6823","35.1119","35.048","35.6167","35.8099","35.743","35.8099","40.1694","36.4285","40.0666","38.52","34.6833","36.7556","36.9","36.0955","34.75","35.4717","41.1862","37.9358","36.95","35.9752","34.4571","41.8542","40.8863","36.0358","38.0667","35.9336","36.9","34.5957","36.9","36.1167","34.7837","36.9","36.817","34.7837","36.9833","36.817","34.7771","40.5144","35.897","35.897","34.7667","39.5661","40.9358","36.9","40.5948","39.6667","35.9752","35.8601","39.7189","35.6167","36.0","35.0169","34.4667","41.3314","36.8153","36.0723","35.35","36.7848","40.9358","34.4935","34.4935","34.4935","34.4935","35.1539","35.9336","39.6957","35.8833","36.8804","35.9714","34.85","40.929","40.9274","40.7483","40.9178","36.817","35.9336","35.9833","41.8542","37.4833","37.8","34.0","34.4833","37.8","39.5661","40.3445","36.817","36.817","34.3667","36.7124","37.65","38.52","39.5705","34.4564","40.06","40.06","36.95","36.817","35.2039","35.6333","40.902","34.9167"],"notes":"25 December: In Bondo town, the west Yimbo chief, Daniel Tiang was found dead at a guest house, likely by poison. 22 December: Police allegedly shot and killed a 23 year-old university student claimig that he was a member of a gang that was terrorising Line Saba residents 20 December: In Siakago, Embu County, unidentified armed group attacked a 15 years old boy.

On 10 Sept 2018, the police allegedly shot dead a young man in Mtongwe, Mombasa following a raid in his home. The killing was done reportedly as part of the police's manhunt for a gang that has been attacking civilians in the local area. On September 10th, three people - including a 17 year old boy - were wounded at a field near Mauche (Nakuru). The attackers, who were believed to come from a nearby (unspecified) community, fired arrows at the civilians. It is probable that this event is connected to violence in neighbouring Narok area. On September 10th, a 13 year old boy was hacked to death, and his 12 year old sister and 70 year old grandmother were wounded in the attack in Esimenwa village (coordinates for Narok town used). The attack follows violence between the Maasai and Kipsigi groups in the area the following week (which some reports attribute to conflicts over land titles, some to cattle rustling, and others to actions by the government and\/or assorted local politicians), though the specific identity of the group of attackers is not specified in the source, nor is the ethnicity of the victims. Police have been deployed to the area, and a suspect has been arrested. On September 6th, police killed three youth who they said were suspected criminals at Utage (Mombasa county). Police dismissed claims that these were extra-judicial killings. On 6 Sept 2018, a man was shot with an arrow during a suspected revenge mission in Nkoben area near Maasai Mau forest in Narok county following the killing in the same area on 4 Sept. Tension in the community was high following the incidents. On September 4th, a herder (of an unspecified ethnicity) was killed in the Nkoben area of the Maasai Mau forest (coordinates for Mau Narok used). This killing sparked two days of violence in Narok (see separate entries). On or before September 4th, off-duty Kenyan police officers demanded bribes from civilians drinking at an illicit brewery in Sondu (Kericho). After detaining several civilians, a crowd formed to release them, and the police fired gunshots to disperse the crowd, wounding a bystander. Senior police are reported to be investigating the incident. On September 3rd, a journalist and a pregnant University student were abducted in Migori. After being attacked, the journalist escaped the moving car he was in, sustaining serious injuries. The student's body was later found in a forest, having been stabbed multiple times, and likely raped. The personal assistant of Governor Okoth Obado has been arrested for allegdly orchestrating the kidnap and murder. Obado was himself charged with aiding and abetting the murder on September 24th. On or before September 3rd, herders grazing their cattle in Boni Forest (Garissa county) were reportedly detained and beaten by the Kenyan military. At least eight herders were beaten, some seriously, and they have been separated from their cattle. The KDF denied that it was conducted any operations in the area. Between approximately 23 Aug and 6 Sept 2018, a suspect in the attempted murder of a former Garissa Finance executive claimed he had been tortured in custody by the police (where he had been for 15 days) and subjected to inhumane conditions while in Gigiri police station. The detainee is allegedly in need of medical attention. On August 27th or 28th, a police officer killed a suspected drug dealer, who had been arrested and taken to the police station, before being shot in the head (note that his death took place on Moses Mudavadi road, and that the source does not specify the circumstances). The police officer in question has been arrested in connection with the killing. On 26 Aug 2018, a matatu driver was wounded in Bomet after a police officer allegedly knocked out his teeth for refusing to accept a bribe. On August 19th, three men attacked the former finance county executive of Garissa county, as he was returning home from a mosque in Kilelshwa (Nairobi). The victim was shot in the head at close range, and was critically injured. On August 28th, the Governor of Garrissa - Ali Korane - was arrested and questioned by police in relations to the incident. He was released but remained a person of interest. Three other suspects were arrested, one of whom reportedly committed suicide. On 16 August, a public service vehicle travelling from Elwak to Mandera was attacked by unidentified gunmen. Three passengers were left in a critical condition. During the month of August, four people were murdered in the sub-district of Butere (Kakamega county), reportedly by a local gang named \"The 42 Brothers\".

Authorities continued to implement the 2013-2017 national action plan through capacity building for officials and employment of the referral mechanism; it commenced development of an updated 2018-2022 version. The advisory committee\u0160the governing body for anti-trafficking efforts\u0160convened quarterly during the reporting period. The advisory committee and other government officials continued to promote anti-trafficking awareness, particularly targeting the prevention of child sex and labor trafficking. The government also launched a campaign centered on Human Trafficking Awareness Day using highway billboards and community outreach programs. Two NGOs organized campaigns via radio interviews, public fora, and conferences with local governments, effectively reaching around 70,000 people in critical coastal regions. However, the government's anti-trafficking awareness efforts were largely limited due to resource constraints. In 2017, the government fully implemented the rules published the year prior, which outlined registration requirements for hundreds of private employment agencies that place Kenyans in work abroad. These requirements included informing Kenyan employees seeking work abroad about their prospective wages, visa fees, airfare, and medical examinations, and specifying that any administrative costs imposed on the employee should not exceed one month's salary. The MOL required contracts deemed credible to be signed in the presence of a labor ministry officer, and required applicants to register with the Kenyan embassy in the host country. During the reporting period, the MOL approved registration for 45 private employment agencies\u0160up from 25 the previous reporting period\u0160and prohibited hundreds of others from recruiting in Kenya; however, the list of vetted employment agencies registered by the MOL was not readily accessible and numerous illegal, unregistered agencies remained in operation. The government reported working only with travel and tourism companies that were part of a Code of Conduct consortium, which was an industry-driven responsible tourism initiative intended to provide awareness, tools, and support to the tourism sector to prevent the sexual exploitation of children. The code was an agreement signed by companies that committed their staff to training on the identification of child exploitation among foreigners and created a general awareness within their facilities. While government efforts to curb child sex tourism improved during the year, local reports claimed most government efforts involved prohibiting the entry of perpetrators into the country rather than arrests and prosecutions. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs provided anti-trafficking training for all newly posted diplomatic personnel and vetted employment contracts between Kenyan diplomats posted abroad and their domestic workers to ensure their legality. The government's training for troops deployed overseas on international peacekeeping missions included a module that addressed human trafficking.","prosecution":"The government maintained law enforcement efforts, but incomplete data from the government made it difficult to fully assess those efforts. Section 1 of the Counter-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2010 criminalized sex and labor trafficking and prescribed a sufficiently stringent punishment of no less than 30 years imprisonment or a fine of not less than 30 million Kenyan shillings ($290,700). By allowing for a fine in lieu of imprisonment for sex trafficking, these penalties were not commensurate with those for other serious crimes, such as rape. Sections 14 and 15 of the Sexual Offenses Act of 2006 criminalized the facilitation of child sex tourism and \ufb01child prostitution,\ufb02 and prescribed punishment of no less than 10 years imprisonment, penalties that were sufficiently stringent and commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. During the reporting period, the government reported an increase in the number of cases it prosecuted under the anti-trafficking law compared to previous years in which it more commonly utilized the 2006 Sexual Offenses Act, exhibiting a stronger understanding of how to effectively employ the anti-trafficking law. During the reporting year, the government began tracking law enforcement data digitally and collecting it on a monthly basis from local police offices in order to ensure its anti-trafficking statistics were accurate, complete, and wholly representative of all 47 counties in Kenya. However, as the government had only begun to implement this change in data collection, it reported partial data from only some regions for the current year. It reported 35 investigations of potential trafficking cases in 2017, compared to 530 in 2016 of which many included smuggling and other trafficking-related crimes. From official data derived from an unknown number of counties in Kenya, the government reported initiating nine sex trafficking prosecutions under the anti-trafficking law; during the previous reporting period, it completed 281 prosecutions, many of which were for smuggling vice trafficking crimes and prosecuted under other laws. At the close of the reported period, the government did not report any trafficking convictions, and the nine prosecutions remained ongoing, compared with 105 convictions in 2016. Prosecutors continued to charge some defendants with immigration violations or labor exploitation vice human trafficking, as the former crimes were deemed easier to prove and less financially costly than the latter. The government did not report the number of prosecutions or convictions it attained under the Sexual Offense Act or the number of those for forced labor; however, various stakeholders reported at least 300 trafficking-related prosecutions during the year, although the government was unable to provide conviction and sentencing details for such crimes. Corruption remained endemic at all levels of government, and traffickers were able to fraudulently obtain identity documents from complicit officials, and police often took bribes to warn traffickers of impending operations and investigations. The government did not report any investigations, prosecutions, or convictions of government employees involved in human trafficking. The national police service, in partnership with an international organization, included content on human trafficking and the anti-trafficking law in its basic training curricula. In 2017, two Kenyan NGOs provided training for an unknown number of police officers and prosecutors in the six coastal counties on how to differentiate between trafficking and smuggling crimes, and multiple international organizations and stakeholders trained an unknown number of immigration officials and airport contractors on how to detect trafficking crimes; the government provided logistical support for these training endeavors. During the reporting period, Kenya Airways\u0160of which the government is the largest shareholder\u0160coded plane tickets to highlight suspected trafficking cases and ftagged those for government officials to intercept during transit at the Kenya International Airport; it did not report how many cases were investigated as a result of this initiative. ","protection":"The government demonstrated uneven protection efforts as it improved identification of and institutional protections for children domestically and adults abroad; however, such services for adult victims in-country remained negligible. Authorities reported identifying and referring to care at least 352 trafficking victims in 2017, of which the vast majority\u0160267\u0160were subjected to forced labor, seven to sexual exploitation, and the remainder unknown; this was compared with its identification and protection of 530 victims in 2016, although many were likely involved in smuggling. During the reporting period, the government provided 60 million Kenyan shillings ($581,400) from the federal budget for anti-trafficking efforts, including implementation of the National Referral Mechanism (NRM) and the victim assistance fund, which is a marked increase from no funds provided during the previous period. By the end of 2017, the government fully implemented the NRM and trained relevant stakeholders on its identification and referral provisions. According to multiple government and civil society stakeholders, identification of child trafficking victims remained stronger than for adults. Identification sources included direct referrals to NGOs from victims or witnesses; reactively by police during investigations; or calls to the government-operated, gender-based violence or NGO-run hotlines. The two national hotlines were operational 24 hours per day, year round; however, unlike the previous two years, the government did not report how many calls either line received during the reporting period. Victim care varied in quality and services consisted of medical care, psycho-social counseling, rehabilitation and reintegration support, food and clothing supply, legal aid, and transportation. The government and NGOs across Kenya jointly provided these 254KENYAprotective provisions, although sometimes NGOs acted alone when the government was too slow or neglected to respond. The government placed some child victims in child-specific rescue centers, supported the familial reunification of others, and assisted with the repatriation of non-Kenyan nationals. It operated drop-in referral centers in Mombasa (Likoni), Malindi, Nyeri, Machakos, Meru, Kakamega, Kisumu, Nyamira, Nakuru, Eldoret, Kericho, and Muranga, and four rescue centers in Garissa, Nairobi, Thika, and Machakos, where child victims of violence, including trafficking victims, could stay for up to three months before returning home or being referred to NGO facilities. To continue addressing the exploitation of Kenyan nationals in Arabian Gulf States, in addition to the Ministry of Labor (MOL)-assigned labor attaches already working in Kenyan missions in Qatar and Saudi Arabia, attaches began working in the UAE during the reporting period to assist citizens employed there. The government also concluded bilateral labor agreements with Saudi Arabia and Qatar to coordinate efforts to reduce cases of exploitative labor and other abuses against Kenyans abroad, to include trafficking; it was under negotiations for such agreements with the UAE and Kuwait at the close of the reporting period. It provided ad hoc monetary and logistical assistance for repatriation of its citizens subjected to trafficking outside Kenya. In some cases, NGOs and destination-country governments coordinated and funded the repatriation of Kenyan nationals without government support. Officials assisted more than 70 Kenyans with their return in 2017, mostly due to poor labor conditions, and an NGO and an international organization reported repatriating 46 Kenyan nationals from Gulf States. Some officials continued to conftate smuggling with trafficking and arrested, without screening, potential trafficking victims for contravening immigration laws. Reports also alleged authorities treated some victims as criminals, particularly women in prostitution, sometimes charging them with labor violations. The government had formal procedures to encourage victims' cooperation in the investigation and prosecution of trafficking crimes, and during the reporting period seven victims utilized the government's victim-witness protection program. Under the anti-trafficking act, officials may grant permission for foreign trafficking victims to remain indefinitely in Kenya if it is believed they would face hardship or retribution upon repatriation; the government did not report using this provision during the reporting period.","recommendation":"Increase protective services available to adult trafficking victims, particularly those identified and repatriated from overseas; ensure potential victims are not inappropriately penalized for crimes committed as a direct result of their being subjected to trafficking; vigorously investigate and prosecute trafficking offenses and convict and punish traffickers, including forced labor cases; amend the anti-trafficking law to remove sentencing provisions that allow fines in lieu of imprisonment; strengthen implementation of the formal process for law enforcement officials to refer trafficking victims for assistance, including adult trafficking victims and repatriated Kenyans; expand training to all levels of the government, particularly front-line responders, on identifying and handling trafficking crimes; continue to expand oversight of overseas recruitment agencies; and conduct awareness campaigns throughout the country, focusing substantially on rural coastal areas.","tier":"TIER 2","traffick_profile":"As reported over the past five years, Kenya is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking. Within the country, children are subjected to forced labor in domestic service, agriculture, fishing, cattle herding, street vending, and begging. Girls and boys are exploited in commercial sex throughout Kenya, including in sex tourism in Nairobi, Kisumu, and on the coast, particularly in informal settlements; at times, their exploitation is facilitated by family members. Children are also exploited in sex trafficking by people working in khat (a mild narcotic) cultivation areas, near gold mines in western Kenya, by truck drivers along major highways, and by fishermen on Lake Victoria. Kenyans are recruited by legal or illegal employment agencies or voluntarily migrate to Europe, the United States, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East\u0160particularly Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Kuwait, Qatar, the UAE, and Oman\u0160in search of employment, where at times they are exploited in domestic servitude, massage parlors and brothels, or forced manual labor. NGOs reported that internally displaced persons, particularly those who live close to a major highway or local trading center, are more vulnerable to trafficking than persons in settled communities. Nairobi-based labor recruiters maintain networks in Uganda and Ethiopia that recruit Rwandan, Ethiopian, and Ugandan workers through fraudulent offers of employment in the Middle East and Asia. Kenya continues to serve as a transit point for Ethiopians and other East Africans seeking work in South Africa, impeding Kenyan authorities' ability to differentiate between trafficking and smuggling. Kenyan women are subjected to forced prostitution in Thailand by Ugandan and Nigerian 255KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OFtraffickers. Men and boys are lured to Somalia to join criminal and terrorist networks, sometimes with fraudulent promises of lucrative employment elsewhere.Kenya's largest refugee camp complex, Dadaab, hosts approximately 230,000 refugees and asylum-seekers, and at times the security situation inhibits some humanitarian access, assistance, and protective services. Some children in Dadaab and Kakuma refugee camps may be subjected to sex trafficking, while others are taken from the camps and forced to work elsewhere. Children from East Africa are subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking in Kenya. Stakeholders assert domestic workers from Uganda, pastoralists from Ethiopia, and others from Somalia, South Sudan, and Burundi are subjected to forced labor in Kenya to work in jobs vacated by Kenyan youth who are being educated; however, this trend is reportedly waning. Nepalese and Indian women recruited to work in mujra dance clubs in Nairobi and Mombasa face debt bondage, which they are forced to pay off by dancing and forced prostitution."},"Lebanon":{"April":1.0,"Asylum Seekers":"9","August":0.0,"December":1.0,"February":0.0,"Friday":2.0,"Global Population":6859.41,"January":0.0,"July":2.0,"June":0.0,"Life Expectancy":78.88,"March":2.0,"May":1.0,"Monday":0.0,"November":0.0,"October":0.0,"Population below $1.90 a day":"0","Saturday":2.0,"September":1.0,"Sunday":2.0,"Thursday":1.0,"Tuesday":0.0,"Violence against civilians":8,"Wednesday":1.0,"fatalities":["0","1","1","0","1","0","1","1"],"government_effort":"NA","introduction":"The Government of Lebanon does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so.

The government demonstrated increasing efforts by investigating and prosecuting significantly more trafficking cases and referring an increased number of trafficking victims to NGO-run protective services. The government continued to partner with several NGOs to provide essential services to victims. However, the government did not meet the minimum standards in several key areas. The government did not directly protect victims or fully implement victim identification and referral procedures stipulated in its anti-trafficking law, which resulted in the potential for some victims to face arrest, detention, or deportation for crimes committed as a result of being subjected to trafficking. Moreover, Lebanon's sponsorship system, which places a significant amount of power in the hands of employers of foreign workers, remained a significant impediment to authorities identifying and protecting trafficking victims.","iso3":"LBN","latitude":["33.8889","33.541","33.5167","33.3978","34.4367","34.1211","34.0389","33.9342"],"location":["Beirut","Ein el Hilweh","Mieh Mieh","Hasbaya","Tripoli","Jbeil","Tell el Abiad","Braytal"],"longitude":["35.4944","35.376999999999995","35.3667","35.685","35.8497","35.6481","36.2094","36.1494"],"notes":"On Dec 23, videos emerged and went viral, showing journalists being assaulted by armed forces and during the demonstrations in Beirut on Sunday.

A young man was killed under unclear circumstances during a security raid in the night of 9 March.","prevention":"The government maintained some efforts to prevent trafficking. The national anti-trafficking steering committee continued its monthly meetings throughout 2017. The government did not adopt the draft national anti-trafficking action plan, but relevant ministries continued to take efforts to implement portions of the plan. The government did not organize any anti-trafficking public awareness campaigns during the reporting period. DGS, MOL, and ISF continued to operate hotlines to receive reports of abuse and migrant worker complaints, including for trafficking crimes, but the government did not report how many trafficking victims were identified through these hotlines. In January 2018, the municipality of Tripoli\u0160in cooperation with an NGO\u0160opened a hotline to report cases of exploitative child street begging. DGS continued a program to inform artiste visa holders about restrictions and obligations of their visa status upon arrival to Beirut International Airport. Under the program, if the visa holder objects to the visa's terms, she is free to return to her home country. During the reporting period, under a directive from the DGS, airport officers continued to return passports directly to foreign domestic workers upon their arrival in Lebanon. In June 2017, the Ministry of Justice and ISF partnered with an international organization and Lebanon's main air carrier to raise awareness of trafficking and victim identification for airline crews. The government made some efforts to reduce the demand for forced labor. The MOL had the authority to close or penalize employment agencies that exploited migrant workers, and it maintained a blacklist of an unknown number of recruitment agencies for committing fraudulent recruitment practices; however, the government did not report prosecuting any recruitment or employment agencies for potential trafficking crimes. Unlike in the previous reporting period, the MOL did not report how many employment agencies it closed for labor violations. The MOL and ISF continued to require Syrian nationals to hold work permits in order to work in the formal sector, which bound these refugees to their employers. However, the government continued to ease the ability of some UNHCR-registered refugees to work in three sectors without any work permit\u0160agriculture, sanitation, and construction\u0160by waiving the fee for residence permit renewals, and made some progress on easing the ability of Syrian teenagers to obtain their own legal Lebanese residency documents when they were too old to be legally resident under their parents' statuses. Following 272LESOTHOan agreement signed in early 2017 between DGS, MOL, and the Farmers' Union in Lebanon that addressed protections of foreign children\u0160primarily Syrians\u0160under the age of 16 from agricultural work, MOL provided training to DGS officers and farmers in the Bekaa Valley and held awareness meetings across Lebanon on child labor in agricultural work. The government did not take steps to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts or address child sex tourism by Lebanese nationals abroad. The government did not provide anti-trafficking training for its diplomatic personnel.","prosecution":"The government significantly increased efforts to investigate and prosecute potential trafficking cases. The 2011 anti-trafficking law criminalized sex and labor trafficking and prescribed penalties of five to 15 years imprisonment. These penalties were sufficiently stringent and, with respect to sex trafficking, commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. The government did not have a law that prohibited or penalized confiscation of workers' passports or travel documents by employers or labor agents. Government officials and NGOs continued to report that some judges lacked understanding of the anti-trafficking law and knowledge of best practices for handling trafficking cases, though they noted improvements in the overall consistency of judges' and prosecutors' application of the law. In 2017, the government reported initiating 134 total trafficking investigations, compared with 71 investigations in 2016. The Internal Security Forces (ISF) anti-trafficking unit investigated 23 cases of suspected trafficking, involving 55 victims of sexual exploitation and child trafficking; this was compared with 20 ISF investigations in 2016. Of the 23 cases, the ISF issued 17 arrest warrants and referred 39 suspected traffickers to the judiciary. The Directorate of General Security (DGS) investigated 111 potential trafficking cases involving migrant workers and other immigrants in 2017, which was a significant increase from 51 investigations in 2016. Among the 111 cases, the DGS referred six to judicial or law enforcement authorities for further investigation and it classified 36 as child labor cases and referred them to the Ministry of Labor (MOL). In 2017, public prosecutors referred 109 trafficking cases to investigative judges, who charged and prosecuted 172 suspected traffickers under the anti-trafficking law; these cases were pending at the end of the reporting period. These cases involved forced prostitution, coerced street begging, and labor exploitation. This demonstrated a significant increase in prosecutions, but a decrease in convictions, in comparison to 2016 when investigative judges charged and prosecuted 71 alleged traffickers, which resulted in 33 convictions under the anti-trafficking law; however, these cases, like many in Lebanon's overworked judicial system, took significant time to resolve. Officials generally sought to resolve trafficking cases involving foreign workers through mediation between the employer and worker, rather than refer them for criminal prosecution. Additionally, government officials continued to report security forces were reluctant to arrest parents for subjecting their children to trafficking, usually in forced begging, due to a lack of social services available should the child be removed from the family. The government did not report investigations, prosecutions, or convictions of government officials complicit in human trafficking offenses during the reporting period; however, NGOs continued to report a common perception that DGS officers allegedly accepted bribes to protect adult nightclubs or issue artiste visas\u0160a program that sustains a significant commercial sex industry and enables sex trafficking. The government encouraged officials to participate in trainings provided by NGOs and during the reporting period, DGS introduced human rights and anti-trafficking training as part of its curriculum for all new DGS recruits. The army continued to require anti-trafficking training for soldiers, while widely distributed military publications featured articles on human trafficking to raise awareness among military officers.","protection":"The government maintained inconsistent victim protection efforts. It referred an increased number of victims to NGOs, 271LEBANONbut victims remained vulnerable to punishment for crimes committed as a direct result of being subjected to trafficking. The government did not formally adopt draft procedures for the identification and referral of victims to NGO services; in practice, officials continued to identify and refer trafficking victims to care on an ad hoc basis. During the course of investigations in 2017, the ISF identified 55 victims of sex trafficking and child trafficking that were referred to NGO-run shelters, compared to the 87 victims it identified in 2016. Nevertheless, NGOs reported they received 56 victim referrals from ISF, DGS, and MOL in 2017, which was an increased number from the 46 victims that government officials referred in 2016. During the reporting period, the ISF adopted a policy to route all cases involving potential trafficking victims through its Human Rights Unit, where officers monitored victims to ensure they were properly identified and cared for per ISF guidelines. The government did not directly provide protection services to trafficking victims but continued to work in cooperation with NGOs to provide essential victim services. NGO-run victim care facilities in Lebanon were dedicated only to female and child victims of trafficking; there were no services available or government resources dedicated to male trafficking victims, who comprised a minority of total victims, mostly through coerced agricultural labor. A longstanding Memorandum of Understanding between the government and an NGO required DGS to refer female victims to an NGO-run safe house and provide security for the location. In 2017, the safe house assisted 218 trafficking victims; victims were not allowed to work while receiving assistance at the safe house. The Ministry of Social Affairs continued to coordinate and fund the provision of protection services to child trafficking victims through contractual agreements with NGOs. During the reporting period, the government collaborated with an NGO to initiate a committee dedicated to drafting a handbook outlining best practices and legal requirements for the protection of trafficking victims and witnesses during investigations and trials. The government continued to arrest, detain, andor deport unidentified victims for crimes committed as a direct result of being subjected to human trafficking, mainly domestic workers who fted abusive employers and out-of-status or illegal migrant workers, but also women holding artiste visas and persons in prostitution. Women holding artiste visas were subject to immediate deportation upon arrest for prostitution violations, and foreign workers without valid residence and work permits were subject to detention for one to two months\u0160or longer in some instances\u0160followed by deportation. ISF and NGO representatives observed decreased rates of detention of sex trafficking victims, in part due to coordination between security forces and prosecutors to proactively screen for trafficking among women in prostitution and refer them to care. The DGS continued to operate a 750-person detention center where authorities detained foreign domestic workers for violating the terms of their work contracts or visas. However, the DGS continued to implement procedures for identifying and referring trafficking victims in the detention center to care facilities, and permitted an NGO to interview detainees to identify trafficking victims among the detention center population; the NGO identified and assisted 29 victims in the center in 2017. The NGO continued to report an increased level of professionalism and sensitivity among DGS officials and investigators. The government did not adopt the draft labor law amendment extending legal protections to foreign workers or the draft law to increase labor protections for domestic workers.Officials did not always encourage victims to file criminal charges against their traffickers, although victims were permitted to file civil suits. Victims were allowed to reside in Lebanon during an investigation of a trafficking case upon a judge's decision, but the government did not report if any judges issued such a decision during the reporting period. Investigations were impeded when victims chose voluntary repatriation rather than facing an often-lengthy trial process because they were not present in the country to testify against their traffickers. NGOs continued to report that foreign victims preferred quick administrative settlements followed by repatriation rather than long criminal prosecutions because of the lack of protection services or resettlement options during the criminal proceedings. The anti-trafficking law stipulated that money earned from trafficking crimes would be confiscated and deposited into a special fund to assist trafficking victims, but the government did not issue an implementing decree to create such a fund. Except for cases involving Syrian refugees, whom the government did not deport, the government did not provide temporary or permanent residency status or other relief from deportation for foreign trafficking victims who faced retribution or hardship in the countries to which they would be deported.","recommendation":"Increase prosecutions and convictions of offenders under the anti-trafficking law, and investigate employers and recruitment agents who withhold workers' passports, travel documents, or wages for potential trafficking crimes; increase efforts to ensure trafficking victims are not arrested, detained, or deported for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being subjected to trafficking, such as immigration or prostitution violations; screen all detained domestic workers for potential trafficking victims in detention centers; develop and implement procedures to identify and refer to protection services trafficking victims among vulnerable populations, such as illegal migrants, women holding artiste visas, domestic workers, and Syrian refugees; take steps to establish greater oversight over artiste visas, a program that contributes to the vulnerability of women to sexual exploitation; increase efforts to train judges, prosecutors, law enforcement officials, and diplomatic personnel about the crime of trafficking and application of the anti-trafficking law; continue to work in partnership with NGOs to screen for, identify, and provide protection services to victims, including witness support during criminal proceedings; prohibit and penalize the withholding of workers' passports and travel documents, reform the sponsorship system to ensure workers are not bound to abusive employers, and allow workers, including artiste visa holders, freedom of movement; formally establish the victim assistance fund; adopt and implement the draft national action plan; enact the labor law amendment extending legal protections to foreign workers and the draft law providing increased labor protections to domestic workers; and launch an awareness-raising campaign.","tier":"TIER 2","traffick_profile":"As reported over the past five years, Lebanon is a source and destination country for women and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking and\u0160to a lesser extent\u0160a destination country for Syrian refugee men subjected to forced labor. Women and girls from South and Southeast Asia and an increasing number from East and West Africa are subjected to domestic servitude in Lebanon. Under Lebanon's sponsorship system, foreign workers who leave their employers' houses without permission forfeit their legal status, increasing their vulnerability to re-trafficking. Lebanese government officials and NGOs report most employers withhold their workers' passports, putting workers at risk of trafficking, and NGOs report that abuse of domestic workers is typically underreported. Many migrant workers arrive in Lebanon through legal employment agencies, but are subsequently placed in abusive or exploitative situations with their employers; some employment agencies recruit workers through fraudulent or false job offers. Women from Eastern Europe and North Africa legally enter Lebanon to work primarily as dancers in nightclubs through Lebanon's artiste visa program, which is valid for three months and can be renewed once. The government reported 10,363 women entered Lebanon under this program in 2017; 11,284 artiste visa holders entered Lebanon in 2016. The terms of the artiste visa prohibit foreign women working in these nightclubs to leave the hotel where they reside, except to work in the nightclubs which sponsor them, and nightclub owners withhold the women's passports and control their movement; these women also experience physical and sexual abuse, withheld wages, and domestic servitude. There are increasing reports that traffickers, including parents, force children to beg in the streets.Men, women, and children among the estimated 1.3 million Syrian refugees in Lebanon are at high risk of sex trafficking and forced labor. There are some restrictions on Syrians' ability to work legally in Lebanon and the enforcement of visas and residence permit laws increase this population's vulnerability to trafficking. Syrians are commonly involved in the exploitation of other Syrians in Lebanon, particularly targeting refugees fteeing the conftict. For example, traffickers hold Syrian refugee men, women, and children in bonded labor in order to pay for food, shelter, and the cost of transit to Lebanon, and contract out groups of refugees to work in the agricultural sector in the Bekaa Valley. An international organization reported in 2015 evidence of bonded labor within refugee communities where child labor is used in exchange for living in informal tented settlements. Child labor among the Syrian refugee population continues to increase, particularly in agriculture, construction, and street vending and begging. These children are highly vulnerable to labor trafficking, especially in the agricultural sector of Bekaa and Akkar and on the streets of main urban areas such as Beirut and Tripoli. NGOs report that some children are forced or coerced to conduct criminal activity. Syrian women and girls are highly vulnerable to sex trafficking. In March 2016, Lebanese authorities reported on an extensive sex trafficking ring exploiting primarily Syrian women and girls in Beirut; the majority of the women and girls were recruited from Syria with false promises of work and subjected to commercial sexual exploitation in which they experienced mental, physical, and sexual abuse and forced abortions. Syrian girls are brought to Lebanon for sex trafficking, sometimes through the guise of early marriage. Some Syrian refugee women and girls are forced into sex acts or early marriage, often by family members or powerful local families, in order to ease economic hardships; these women and girls are highly vulnerable to trafficking. Syrian LGBTI refugees continue to be vulnerable to sexual exploitation. An international organization reported in 2017 that some employers coerce Syrian refugee men to perform sexual acts through threats of withholding their pay or terminating their employment. An international organization reported in 2016 that some Lebanese children are involved in armed tribal violence in Bekaa and Tripoli, some of whom may be forced to conduct such activity. There is also evidence of children within the Syrian refugee community in Lebanon that are associated with armed groups, who have either fought in the Syrian conftict or intend to fight in Syria as child soldiers."},"Liberia":{"April":0.0,"Asylum Seekers":"3","August":0.0,"December":0.0,"February":1.0,"Friday":0.0,"Global Population":4818.97,"January":0.0,"July":0.0,"June":0.0,"Life Expectancy":63.73,"March":0.0,"May":0.0,"Monday":0.0,"November":0.0,"October":0.0,"Population below $1.90 a day":"40.9","Saturday":0.0,"September":0.0,"Sunday":0.0,"Thursday":0.0,"Tuesday":1.0,"Violence against civilians":1,"Wednesday":0.0,"fatalities":["0"],"government_effort":"NA","introduction":"The Government of Liberia does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. The government demonstrated significant efforts during the reporting period by prosecuting and convicting four traffickers in one case, its first trafficking convictions in four years, and providing shelter and services for at least three trafficking victims. However, the government did not demonstrate overall increasing efforts compared to the previous reporting period. It did not provide training or basic resources for law enforcement and prosecutors to investigate and prosecute trafficking cases; complicity and corruption inhibited anti-trafficking law enforcement action; and the government did not allocate an operating budget or resources to the anti-trafficking task force or its working-level body, the TIP Secretariat, which severely limited their activities. Therefore Liberia remained on Tier 2 Watch List for the second consecutive year.","iso3":"LBR","latitude":["6.3494"],"location":["Mount Barclay"],"longitude":["-10.6531"],"notes":"Two men are said to have reportedly gone missing from former Finance Minister David Farhat's farm following a tussle over a piece of land with another group that is said to be claiming the land in the Mount Barclay area in Montserrado County.","prevention":"The government maintained minimal efforts to prevent trafficking in persons. The anti-trafficking task force met irregularly and neither the anti-trafficking task force nor the TIP Secretariat had an operating budget; as a result, they did not implement any activities in the 2014-2019 anti-trafficking national action plan. In addition, other government offices continued to use the TIP Secretariat's dedicated vehicle for their offices' non-anti-trafficking purposes, leaving the Secretariat without transportation to investigate cases. In collaboration with an NGO, the MOL continued to staff an anti-trafficking hotline during business hours; it did not report whether it received any trafficking reports during the reporting period. LNP, with some international support, visited approximately 25 beaches and 80 entertainment centers in Monrovia known to have high instances of child sex trafficking, spoke with community groups, and distributed more than 200 ftyers to sensitize citizens on child protection issues. MOGCSP continued a government-funded program to provide shelter, psychological counseling, 276LITHUANIAand family reunification to vulnerable street children. The government did not make discernible efforts to reduce the demand for forced labor or commercial sex acts. The government did not have the resources to regularly monitor artisanal gold mining operations\u0160where most child labor in the gold mining sector took place\u0160for child or forced child labor, and it did not have any inspectors dedicated to child labor or forced child labor. The government provided anti-trafficking training for its diplomatic personnel; however, there were allegations that two Liberian diplomats in the United Kingdom engaged in human trafficking.","prosecution":"The government increased anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts. The 2005 Act to Ban Trafficking in Persons criminalized labor trafficking and sex trafficking and prescribed minimum sentences of one year imprisonment for adult trafficking and six years imprisonment for child trafficking but did not include maximum sentences. The prescribed penalties for child trafficking were sufficiently stringent, but those prescribed for adult trafficking were not. The penalties for sex trafficking were not commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape or kidnapping.The government investigated eight suspects in four cases and prosecuted and convicted four traffickers, an increase from four investigations, two prosecutions, and no convictions the previous reporting period. Prosecutors often pursued other charges that were more likely to result in a guilty verdict, including rape, in lieu of sex trafficking. In one case that continued from the previous reporting period, judges prosecuted four individuals for illicit human trafficking, and the primary suspect, a Sierra Leonean, was convicted and sentenced to 10 years imprisonment. The other three suspects\u0160one Sierra Leonean and two Liberians\u0160were convicted for facilitation of human trafficking and each received a sentence of one year imprisonment. These were the government's first trafficking convictions in four years and its first convictions of Liberian traffickers under the 2005 law. A second investigation was ongoing at the end of the reporting period. The government reported investigations of government officials allegedly complicit in human trafficking offenses; however, it did not report efforts to prosecute or convict allegedly complicit officials. Police investigated a government official for involvement in the alleged illegal transport of five Liberian children to the United States in a previous reporting period. It was unclear whether the allegations were for human trafficking or smuggling. A law enforcement official reportedly intervened to hasten the end of the investigation and clear the accused. In January 2018, the United Kingdom expelled two Liberian diplomats. Reports indicated one of several reasons was allegedly facilitating prostitution. NGOs and officials reported some government employees were directly complicit in child trafficking, including for domestic servitude and street hawking. The Women and Children Protection Section (WACPS) of the Liberian National Police (LNP) was responsible for investigating most trafficking cases. The Ministry of Labor (MOL) was responsible for investigating adult forced labor, and the Liberian Immigration Service (LIS) could investigate transnational trafficking. The LNP did not have dedicated anti-trafficking funding or in-kind support and therefore lacked basic 275LIBERIAresources and equipment to fully respond to and investigate allegations of trafficking, especially outside the capital. The government did not provide anti-trafficking training for officials but provided in-kind support for two officials to attend an international training. New WACPS and LIS officials received anti-trafficking training as part of their induction. Officials reported many labor inspectors, police, prosecutors, and judges remained largely unable to identify trafficking, which posed serious impediments to investigating and prosecuting such cases. In addition, some high-level officials did not have a clear understanding of trafficking.","protection":"The government maintained modest efforts to identify and protect trafficking victims. The government and NGOs identified at least four trafficking victims, compared to five trafficking victims and 25 suspected trafficking victims identified the previous reporting period. Poor record keeping outside the capital and inadequate resources hindered reliable data collection, and statistics were often not disaggregated to differentiate trafficking from similar crimes. While the government had standard procedures to identify trafficking victims, authorities reported the majority of law enforcement, immigration, and social services personnel lacked training on such procedures, and some trafficking victims were identified as victims of other crimes. Many officials continued to view internal trafficking, especially child domestic servitude, as a community practice rather than a crime. Due to a lack of awareness of trafficking among authorities and communities, as well as insufficient government resources to identify trafficking victims, most trafficking victims remained unidentified. Despite these shortcomings, the government did not provide training on such measures. The draft national referral mechanism to direct victims towards services, developed by the task force, did not receive final approval for the third year. As a result, the government remained without a formal process to refer victims to care, and agencies responsible rarely coordinated such efforts. Police and community members generally referred trafficking victims to the Ministry of Gender, Children, and Social Protection (MOGCSP). The anti-trafficking task force working group, of which the MOGCSP was a member\u0160was responsible for coordinating victim care. In cases involving one victim, the members of the task force referred the victim to a government or NGO safe house or coordinated foster care. When authorities identified a group of potential trafficking victims, the individuals were either referred to NGOs for care or funds were provided by either the MOGCSP or the Ministry of Justice to provide care in government shelters. In part because the government did not have consistent funding for victim care and officials did not receive training on referral procedures, not all identified victims of crime, including trafficking, received comprehensive care during the reporting period. While government-provided shelter and services remained basic and short-term, the government took steps to improve the shelters and child protection services broadly. MOGSCP operated two shelters for victims of sexual and gender-based violence and trafficking, as well as 12 transit centers throughout the country, and LNP operated one victim safe house. The shelters provided long-term care and social services, while the transit centers provided medical services and short-term accommodation. In theory, each transit center had at least one social worker, one nurse trained in sexual- and gender-based violence cases, and one police officer on staff; however, resources allocated to each center varied, and officials reported only three of Monrovia's five transit centers had sufficient space and staffing to care for victims. Most of the transit centers did not actually provide short-term accommodations. The Ministry of Health could provide limited medical and psycho-social services. The government relied heavily on NGOs and private shelters when government shelters were unavailable. During the reporting period, MOGCSP embedded two social workers within the WACPS to assist women and children, including trafficking victims, at the police safe house. LNP provided food and other in-kind support to the police safe house, and the government renovated several short-term transit centers during the reporting period. In addition, the MOGCSP provided some funding to support short-term shelter in a transit center and psycho-social support to at least three victims during the reporting period. Shelter and services were available to both domestic and foreign victims. NGO shelters and MOGCSP facilities\u0160including those outside the capital\u0160could accommodate male victims. Adult victims were sometimes allowed to leave the shelters at will; in some cases, however, shelter workers restricted victims from leaving, citing safety and to protect the integrity of the testimony at trial. Shelters often could not protect victims' identities, and stays were limited, usually to three months due to capacity. MOGSCP could arrange foster care for victims who required longer term care. MOGSCP increased collaboration with NGOs through regular meetings of the Child Protection Network, which facilitated government-NGO partnership on child protection cases. The government collaborated with the Government of Sierra Leone to repatriate a Sierra Leonean trafficking victim identified in Liberia.The government did not systematically encourage victims to participate in investigations and prosecutions of their traffickers but had at times provided victim-witnesses support to offset the costs of participating in a trial; it did not report providing these services during the reporting period. The anti-trafficking law provided for restitution, and victims could file civil suits against their traffickers; no victims received restitution or filed civil suits during the reporting period. The government did not have a formal policy that provided alternatives to removal to countries in which victims would face retribution or hardship but could offer alternatives, including temporary residency, on a case-by-case basis. There were no reports the government detained, fined, or jailed victims for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being subjected to trafficking; however, due to a lack of training on victim identification and the absence of measures to screen for trafficking among vulnerable populations, it was possible that victims remained unidentified in the law enforcement system.","recommendation":"Increase efforts to investigate, prosecute, and convict traffickers; train and equip law enforcement, immigration officials, and social workers to identify, investigate, and prosecute trafficking offenses; provide operating and victim protection budgets to the anti-trafficking task force; finalize the national referral mechanism, and train law enforcement and social workers on implementation; expand victim services\u0160particularly for victims outside the capital, males, and long-term care\u0160through increased financial or in-kind support to shelters; create and train officials on measures to identify trafficking victims among vulnerable populations, such as people in prostitution; enforce the 2005 law requiring restitution be paid to trafficking victims; increase efforts to educate the public on all forms of human trafficking; continue to assist citizens with registering births and obtaining identity documents; and enact legislation that prescribes sufficiently stringent penalties for adult trafficking and sex trafficking penalties that are commensurate with the penalties for rape.","tier":"TIER 2 WATCH LIST","traffick_profile":"As reported over the past five years, Liberia is a source and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking. Trafficking within the country from rural to urban areas is more prevalent than transnational trafficking, and the majority of victims are children. Most trafficking victims originate from and are exploited within the country's borders, where they are subjected to domestic servitude, forced begging, sex trafficking, or forced labor in street vending, gold and alluvial diamond mines, and on rubber plantations. Traffickers typically operate independently and are commonly family members who promise poorer relatives a better life for their children or promise young women a better life for themselves, take the children or women to urban areas, and exploit them in forced street vending, domestic servitude, or sex trafficking. Traffickers are also often well respected community benefactors who exploit the \ufb01foster care\ufb02 system common across West Africa. While Liberian law requires parents to register children within 14 days of birth, fewer than five percent of births are registered. Although the government has made improvements in birth registration accessibility, continued lack of birth registration and identity documents increase individuals' vulnerability to trafficking. Orphaned children are vulnerable to exploitation, including in street selling and child sex trafficking. In some poor families, parents encourage their daughters to be exploited in prostitution to supplement family income. Liberian nationals and\u0160to a lesser extent\u0160foreigners exploit children in sex trafficking in Monrovia. Officials have documented allegations of women in sex trafficking in Chinese-run hotels. Authorities identified two groups of suspected traffickers from Sierra Leone operating in Liberia during the reporting period. A small number of Liberian men, women, and children are subjected to human trafficking in other West African countries, including Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea, Mauritania, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria. Women from Tunisia and Morocco have been subjected to sex trafficking in Liberia, and Liberian women have been subjected to forced labor in Lebanon and Finland."},"Libya":{"April":6.0,"Asylum Seekers":"7","August":3.0,"December":14.0,"February":12.0,"Friday":10.0,"Global Population":6678.56,"January":21.0,"July":4.0,"June":2.0,"Life Expectancy":72.72,"March":13.0,"May":7.0,"Monday":14.0,"November":17.0,"October":12.0,"Population below $1.90 a day":"NA","Saturday":22.0,"September":2.0,"Sunday":25.0,"Thursday":13.0,"Tuesday":13.0,"Violence against civilians":113,"Wednesday":16.0,"fatalities":["0","0","0","0","0","2","0","0","0","2","0","6","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","1","11","0","3","0","0","1","0","0","0","2","0","4","0","0","1","2","0","0","0","0","0","0","3","0","0","0","0","1","1","0","0","3","2","1","2","0","0","1","1","1","0","0","1","1","0","0","0","0","0","3","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","2","0","0","0","10","1","0","25","3","10","0","0","0","11","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1"],"government_effort":"The government appointed an anti-trafficking focal point but lacked institutional capacity to address human trafficking crimes. Libyan law criminalized some forms of sex trafficking but did not criminalize labor trafficking. Articles 418, 419, and 420 criminalized some forms of sex trafficking involving women and children; however, inconsistent with international law, the definition of trafficking did not include trafficking offenses that were not transnational in nature and, with respect to women, did not criminalize sex trafficking acts that were induced through fraudulent or coercive means. The law did not criminalize sex trafficking involving adult male victims and it did not address labor trafficking. Article 418 prescribed penalties of up to 10 years imprisonment and a fine between 100 and 500 Libyan dinars ($74-$368), which were sufficiently stringent but not commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious crimes such as rape. Articles 425 and 426 criminalized slavery and prescribed penalties of five to 15 years imprisonment. Article 426 criminalized the buying and selling of slaves and prescribed penalties of up to 10 years imprisonment. These penalties were sufficiently stringent and, with respect to sex trafficking, commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious crimes. As the criminal judicial system was not fully functioning in 2017, the government did not report prosecuting or convicting any trafficking offenders. The Ministry of Interior (MOI), which was nominally responsible for anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts, was unable to carry out any anti-trafficking operations during the majority of the reporting period. The MOI's Department to Combat Irregular Migration (DCIM) did not have full control over its approximately 24-33 detention centers where it detained migrants throughout the reporting period. After an international media outlet publicized a video in November 2017 depicting the sale of African migrants in Libya, the GNA initiated an investigation into allegations of trafficking through the formation of an inter-ministerial investigative committee and publicly committed to holding the perpetrators accountable. Libya's Office of the Attorney  General publicly announced in March 2018 that it issued arrest warrants for 205 people for human trafficking and other crimes related to this case, noting that security forces and other government officials were allegedly complicit in the case; the case was ongoing at the end of the reporting period. The government did not report additional investigations, prosecutions, or convictions of government officials who were allegedly complicit in trafficking crimes\u0160including Libyan Coast Guard officials, immigration officers, security officials, as well as DCIM prison officials and detention camp guards who allowed private employers to force detained migrants to work on farms and construction sites. According to an international organization, the Special Deterrence Force, an armed group affiliated with the MOI, arrested migrants in Tripoli and detained some of them at DCIM-run facilities or released them to various migrant smuggling rings, some of which may have also subjected the migrants to forced labor or sex trafficking. Additionally, during the reporting period, the defense ministry continued to operate an anti-illegal migration unit with strong affiliation to one of the two armed groups involved in migrant smuggling and human trafficking in northern Libya; this allegiance allowed the armed group to continually shift its activities from committing smuggling and trafficking crimes to policing migrants for the government. The government also did not report any efforts to investigate or punish government-aligned militias or other armed groups that recruited and used child soldiers. The government did not have any policy structures, institutional capacity, or resources to proactively identify and protect trafficking victims among vulnerable groups, such as foreign migrants, street children, women in prostitution, child victims of sexual abuse, and those recruited and used by armed groups. The government regularly arrested, detained, and otherwise punished victims for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being subjected to human trafficking, such as immigration and prostitution violations. The government continued to operate rehabilitation centers for women in prostitution and victims of sex trafficking and other forms of sexual abuse, which reportedly operated as de facto prisons. Female victims of crimes, including trafficking, faced ridicule, harassment, and humiliation by predominantly male law enforcement and judicial officials in Libya. The government also continued to arbitrarily detain migrants, potentially including trafficking victims, for indefinite periods of time in DCIM-run detention facilities, which suffered from massive overcrowding and dire sanitation problems; those detained had no access to medical care, legal aid, and other forms of protective services. Detained victims were also reportedly subjected to sexual violence and rape, ill-treatment, and unlawful killings. Moreover, authorities made no effort to protect detained foreign migrants, including those already potentially victimized in trafficking situations, in both official and unofficial detention centers from being sold into forced labor. The government did not have formal procedures to safely and humanely transfer identified trafficking victims, who were detained, arrested, or in custody, to protective care. During the reporting period, the government publicly welcomed international organizations to assist refugees and migrants, a population vulnerable to trafficking. For example, it allowed an organization to access DCIM-run detention facilities to administer basic services to migrants, and in November 2017, it finalized an agreement with an organization to open a migrant transit center in Tripoli, which would serve as a safe place for migrants and trafficking victims to register for repatriation or transit to third countries. Libyan authorities waived exit fees and facilitated exit visas for more than 300 refugees whom an international organization evacuated from the country, while it also allowed an international organization to assist in the voluntary repatriation of more than 19,000 third-country nationals, a group particularly vulnerable to trafficking. The government did not, however, provide foreign trafficking victims with legal alternatives to their removal to countries where they faced hardship or retribution. The government did not encourage victims to participate in the investigation and prosecution of traffickers. Libya is a party to the 2000 UN TIP Protocol, but the government lacked the institutional capacity and resources to prevent human trafficking. Alleged government complicity further exacerbated the overall human trafficking problem in the country and the region. The government did not implement measures to prevent government officials or armed groups from forcing detained migrants to work; on the contrary, the government's system of detaining migrants facilitated trafficking crimes. During the reporting period, the GNA coordinated with the Italian government to reduce the ftow of irregular migrants crossing the Mediterranean. However, some European and international NGOs criticized this coordinated effort of turning migrant boats back to Libya and stopping other migrants from attempting the crossing to Italy, citing poor security and human rights conditions and an increased risk of trafficking for migrants forced to remain in Libya. The GNA and Italian government also maintained agreements on judicial cooperation and extraditions. During the reporting period, the GNA made several public statements condemning the exploitation and inhumane treatment of migrants and affirmed its commitment to investigate allegations of trafficking and to hold traffickers criminally accountable. During the reporting period, the government participated in regional meetings, seminars, and workshops related to human trafficking under the framework of the League of Arab Nations and the UN. The GNA foreign ministry co-chaired two migration working groups with an international organization, which aimed to coordinate strategies and policies on migration. The government did not have a national coordinating body responsible for combating human trafficking, but it named a point of contact for trafficking-related inquiries. The government did not conduct any public anti-trafficking awareness campaigns, nor did it take actions to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts, child sex tourism, or forced labor. The government took no steps to prevent the recruitment and use of children by militia groups, groups affiliated to or aligned with the government, and other armed groups operating throughout the country. The government did not provide anti-trafficking training for its diplomatic personnel. ","introduction":"Libya is a Special Case for the third consecutive year. The Libyan Government of National Accord (GNA) struggled to gain institutional capacity and the resources to address trafficking, as the government was focused on consolidating control over its territory and countering violent extremism throughout 2017. The judicial system was not fully functioning during the reporting period, as courts in major cities throughout the country have not been operational since 2014. Violence driven by militias, civil unrest, and increased lawlessness continued to plague Libya throughout the reporting period. Extra-legal armed groups continued to fill a security vacuum across the country; such groups varied widely in their make-up and the extent to which they were under the direction of state authorities. These groups also committed human rights abuses, including unlawful killings. During the year, there were continued reports of the sale and trafficking of African migrants for labor or other exploitative purposes by criminal networks, government officials, and private employers. Accurate information on human trafficking continued to be difficult to obtain, in large part due to the withdrawal of many diplomatic missions, international organizations, and NGOs in 2014.

Since 2013, numerous reports indicate militias, some of which are used as combat forces or security enforcement by the government, recruit and use Libyan children younger than 18 years old. Children associated with armed groups are also reportedly exposed to sexual violence. Instability and lack of government oversight in Libya continued to allow for human trafficking crimes to persist and become highly profitable for traffickers. Trafficking victims\u0160including men, women, and children\u0160are highly vulnerable to extreme violence and other human rights violations in Libya by government officials and non-state armed groups, including physical, sexual, and verbal assault; abduction  for ransom; arbitrary killings; and inhumane detention. Migrants in Libya are extremely vulnerable to trafficking, including those seeking employment in Libya or transiting Libya en route to Europe. The country continued to serve as the primary departure point for migrants, including unaccompanied minors, crossing the Mediterranean from North Africa. As of December 2017, 147,600 migrants departed from Libya to cross the central Mediterranean, while more than 3,000 died en route due to heavily overcrowded or capsized boats. A fear of GNA Libyan Coast Guard units, who allegedly return migrants rescued at sea to detention centers in Libya where they are subjected to forced labor, caused some migrants to refuse the help of these units at sea. Highly organized trafficking and migrants smuggling networks that reach into Libya from Niger, Nigeria, Chad, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia, Sudan, and other sub-Saharan states subject migrants to forced labor and forced prostitution through fraudulent recruitment, confiscation of identity and travel documents, withholding or non-payment of wages, debt bondage, and verbal, physical, and sexual abuse. In some cases, migrants reportedly pay smuggling fees to reach Tripoli, but once they cross the Libyan border they are sometimes abandoned in southern cities or the desert where they are susceptible to severe forms of abuse and human trafficking. For example, in January 2018, 94 migrants escaped detention by their smugglers in the border area of Tazerbou Municipality while transiting northward to disembarkation points; these migrants were highly vulnerable to exploitation. Armed groups, criminal gangs and networks, smugglers, and traffickers have cooperated and competed in the smuggling and trafficking of migrants to and through Libya, while carrying out serious human rights abuses and violations against migrants. Elements of the GNA Libyan Coast Guard have reportedly worked with armed groups and other criminals, including traffickers, to exploit migrants for profit. There are financial incentives for smugglers and traffickers to prevent the disembarkation of migrants transiting the Mediterranean and to re-transit migrants back to Libya for detention and further exploitation. Several credible sources continue to report that migrants\u0160some of whom are trafficking victims\u0160held in detention centers controlled by both the DCIM and non-state armed groups and militias were subjected to severe abuse, rampant sexual violence, denial of medical care, and forced labor. Private employers and prison officials use detained migrants from official and unofficial detention centers for forced labor as domestic workers, garbage collectors, and construction, road paving, and agricultural workers. Once the work is completed, employers return the migrants to detention. In November 2017, an international media outlet released a video depicting unidentified individuals selling African migrants reportedly for labor in an undisclosed location in Libya. Migrant returnees from Libya have also reported being sold by individuals and employers for labor or other exploitative purposes. Additionally, an international organization reported in 2017 that many militias in Libya fill their ranks with migrants from Niger, Nigeria, and Chad to perform labor or serve in other non-combat roles. Female migrants, in particular, are highly vulnerable to sexual assault by various armed groups and smugglers along the migration routes to Libya. Prostitution rings reportedly subject sub-Saharan women and some girls to sex trafficking in brothels, particularly in southern Libya. Nigerian women and girls, in particular, seem to be at increased risk of being forced into prostitution. According to a European NGO, Nigerian gangs recruit Nigerian girls from rural regions of the country and facilitate the transportation of the girls through Libya for sex trafficking in Italy and other European countries. For example, in 2016 a trafficking network that spanned from Nigeria to Italy via Libya involved a group of Nigerian and Libyan traffickers that forced Nigerian women into prostitution in both Libya and Italy; the network held the victims in warehouses in Sebha and Tripoli until it transported them to Sicily for further sexual exploitation. In 2015 and 2016, ISIS in Libya abducted and took into captivity at least 540 migrants and refugees, including at least 63 women whom ISIS forced into sexual slavery for its fighters. However, since the defeat of ISIS across most of eastern Libya, there were limited reports of such incidents in 2017."},"Madagascar":{"April":1.0,"Asylum Seekers":0.72,"August":3.0,"December":6.0,"February":3.0,"Friday":4.0,"Global Population":26262.31,"January":11.0,"July":2.0,"June":3.0,"Life Expectancy":66.68,"March":2.0,"May":1.0,"Monday":4.0,"November":0.0,"October":1.0,"Population below $1.90 a day":"77.6","Saturday":6.0,"September":2.0,"Sunday":9.0,"Thursday":1.0,"Tuesday":5.0,"Violence against civilians":35,"Wednesday":6.0,"fatalities":["1","1","0","2","0","4","1","1","1","1","2","0","0","0","1","1","1","2","2","3","0","2","1","0","0","2","1","1","1","1","1","1","3","0","1"],"government_effort":"NA","introduction":"  WATCH LISTThe Government of Madagascar does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. The government demonstrated significant efforts during the reporting period by operationalizing a new Morals and Child Protection Unit (SPEM), coordinating with law enforcement of a foreign government to investigate a trafficking network, and referring more victims to care. However, the government did not demonstrate increasing efforts compared to the previous reporting period. Despite continued reports of alleged complicity during the year, it did not hold any complicit officials accountable, and did not investigate reports of officials facilitating child sex trafficking. The government continued to lack formal procedures to proactively identify trafficking victims, and did not systematically provide services to victims. For the second consecutive year, the government did not provide funding to the National Office to Combat Trafficking, inhibiting its ability to lead national efforts, raise awareness, and operationalize the national action plan. Therefore Madagascar remained on Tier 2 Watch List for the second consecutive year.","iso3":"MDG","latitude":["-23.15","-17.3333","-18.8726","-23.5381","-18.9386","-21.5837","-16.2271","-18.9386","-20.5528","-19.803","-23.0167","-18.0635","-23.15","-18.9386","-19.1833","-19.5167","-22.3333","-18.3998","-19.8333","-23.9167","-13.3083","-19.15","-18.3998","-18.9386","-16.4667","-23.3528","-18.6745","-19.8659","-15.433","-15.433","-21.1617","-12.7333","-17.5","-20.3802","-23.3528"],"location":["Tsaratanana","Tsararano","Analamahitsy","Ankazoabo","Antananarivo","Ambalavao","Befotoana","Antananarivo","Ambatofinandrahana","Manjakandriana","Analakazo-Ambararata","Maintirano","Tsaratanana","Antananarivo","Amboditavolo","Miandrivazo","Sakalalina","Anjozorobe","Antanifotsy","Analamasina","Nosy-Be","Bekopaka","Anjozorobe","Antananarivo","Ambato Boeny","Toliara","Antsalova","Antsirabe","Maroantsetra","Maroantsetra","Ikalamavony","Anivorano Avaratra","Ambondroala","Mahabo","Toliara"],"longitude":["47.3","46.35","47.5518","44.5111","47.5167","46.9864","46.7525","47.5167","46.8037","48.5746","45.4833","44.0295","47.3","47.5167","48.8833","45.4667","46.4833","47.8565","47.0167","44.8167","48.2646","44.8","47.8565","47.5167","46.7167","43.6667","44.6194","47.0333","49.744","49.744","46.5952","49.2333","48.25","44.6667","43.6667"],"notes":"31 December.

The National Office to Combat Trafficking, intended to lead national efforts, did not receive funding or demonstrate leadership in driving national efforts or raising awareness and did not undertake steps to operationalize the national action plan. The government continued to employ a national toll-free hotline to report child abuse, including child trafficking. The Ministry of Justice continued its anti-trafficking awareness campaign to educate the public on the 2014 anti-trafficking law through weekly national radio broadcasts. A 2013 ban on domestic worker travel to Gulf countries remained in place; however, illicit recruitment agencies circumvented the ban by sending workers through Mauritius, Kenya, Comoros, and the Seychelles. In an attempt to address this issue and identify agencies involved in fraudulent recruitment, the government continued its suspension of all existing accreditations for placement agencies and, thus, its prohibition of recruitment of workers for employment abroad. These prohibitions continued to leave migrant workers vulnerable to blackmail and human trafficking. The government did not make progress on the effort to set up a tripartite agreement between the government, placement agencies, and vocational training centers. The government did not collaborate with destination country governments to protect Malagasy migrant workers and jointly address cases of abuse. The government made some efforts to reduce the demand for sex tourism; in 2017, the Ministry of Tourism, in partnership with international organizations, facilitated approximately 1,000 tourism operators in 12 regions to accede to the Tourism Code of Conduct against Commercial Child Sexual Exploitation and Sex Tourism. The Ministry of Tourism conducted hotel inspections, reminding hotels of their obligation to display posters publicizing the prohibition of child sexual exploitation in their reception areas; the government also maintained such billboards at airports as a warning for tourists. However, despite the prevalence of sex tourism, the government did not report any prosecutions or convictions for sex tourism, and reports of official complicity in such crimes continued. The government did not provide anti-trafficking training to its troops prior to their deployment abroad as part of international peacekeeping missions.","prosecution":"The government slightly decreased law enforcement efforts and reports of alleged official complicity continued during the year. Law No.2014-040 criminalized sex and labor trafficking, including sexual exploitation, labor trafficking, forced labor, forced begging, and debt bondage. It prescribed penalties ranging from two to five years imprisonment and financial penalties; child trafficking convictions were subject to penalties of five to 10 years imprisonment and financial penalties. These penalties were sufficiently stringent and, with respect to sex trafficking, commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. National statistics on prosecutions and convictions remained difficult to obtain and verify, as there was no national database for trafficking crimes. The government reported initiating 32 trafficking investigations, an increase from the previous reporting period for which the government did not report the number of investigations. The government reported initiating the prosecution of 15 alleged traffickers, charging the majority of these suspects under the anti-trafficking law; this is compared with the prosecution of 32 alleged traffickers in 2016. The government also prosecuted 36 alleged traffickers for attempted human trafficking under the 2014 anti-trafficking law for trying to send migrant workers abroad, but it is unclear whether these cases involved attempted trafficking in persons. The government did not report the number of convictions, a decrease from three reported convictions in 2016. The Central Unit of Specialized Investigation and Fight Against Documentary Fraud (SCESLFD) within the National Police reported investigating six cases in which Malagasy women were fraudulently recruited for work on Chinese tea plantations, but instead were forced to marry Chinese men and were subjected to involuntary servitude. In a separate case, the SCESLFD police unit cooperated with law enforcement officials from China to investigate a trafficking network suspected of sending women and children to China for sex trafficking and forced labor. Once alerted, the Chinese police located and arrested the suspected trafficker\u0160a Malagasy woman\u0160and extradited her to Madagascar, where the investigation remained ongoing. The SCESLFD also investigated 16 recruitment companies, some of whom may have been fraudulently recruiting workers to send to Kuwait. In partnership with an international organization, the government operationalized SPEM to investigate crimes involving children in rural areas, including trafficking; it investigated five cases of trafficking during the reporting period. The Police Service's Morals and Protection of Minors (PMPM) unit continued to lead anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts in the capital. The government did not report any investigations, prosecutions, or convictions of government officials complicit in trafficking offenses despite allegations of corruption and complicity, including continued reports of an alleged network of government officials involved in falsification of identity documents used to facilitate child sex trafficking. There remained a lack of coordination between agencies combating trafficking in persons and a reluctance of victims to file charges for fear of reprisals. The government facilitated and led workshops, funded by an international organization, to educate law enforcement and civil society in Antananarivo, Mahajanga, Sambava, Fianarantsoa, Antsiranana, and Toliara on the enforcement of the anti-trafficking laws and victim identification and referral.","protection":"The government maintained uneven efforts to protect victims. The government reportedly identified 86 victims, a decrease compared to 117 identified in the previous reporting period. The government reportedly referred at least 57 to care during the reporting period, an increase compared to 41 last reporting period. An NGO identified and assisted 147 victims. However, due to a lack of coordinated data collection at the national level, this data may not be comprehensive. The government reported housing 35 child trafficking victims in a children's shelter and repatriating 12 transnational trafficking victims; this compared to 35 sheltered and 70 repatriated victims in the previous year. The police reported identifying 70 potential victims, to whom they provided temporary accommodation in police stations, given the lack of alternative shelter options across the country. The government reported identifying 16 Malagasy women in China and facilitated, but did not fund, the repatriation of 12, with some receiving travel documents and basic assistance from the Malagasy embassy in China, and all receiving care upon return. An international organization reported there might be as many as 200 Malagasy women still in a rural region of China, who were also victims of the same trafficking scheme where deceptive or coercive brokers defrauded and sold women into marriages to Chinese men for the purpose of involuntary servitude. An NGO in China reported identifying at least two trafficking victims, helped them pursue legal action, and then coordinated their repatriation. The Ministry of Population assisted 10 trafficking victims that returned from Gulf countries where traffickers exploited them as domestic servants; the government provided all the victims with psychological support and medical care, and five victims additionally received financial aid for their socioeconomic reinsertion and vocational training. The government remained without formal national procedures to proactively identify trafficking victims or refer victims for care; however, an international organization had previously supported the creation of a trafficking victim identification and referral manual, which the government updated during the reporting period and disseminated to 80 stakeholders in Antananarivo, Mahajanga, Sambava, Fianarantsoa, Antsiranana, and Toliara. While the government offered some protection services, it is unclear how many victims received these benefits. The Ministry of Population and Social Affairs, in collaboration with an international organization, continued to coordinate approximately 700 child protection networks across the country, a decrease from 780 in the prior reporting period. These networks were mandated to protect children from various forms of abuse and exploitation, as well as to ensure access to medical and psychological services for victims. However, during the reporting period, the networks' ability to provide protective services were inadequate, as they generally referred victims to NGOs to receive care. Four government hospitals had one-stop victim support centers that offered assistance to child victims of various abuses, including sex trafficking; the one-stop support centers were located in Antananarivo, Toamasina, Mahajanga, and Nosy Be and offered victims medical assistance, psychological support, and access to the police and social workers, but the government did not report how many victims received assistance at these facilities. The Ministry of Population in Nosy Be continued to operate a foster care program for exploited children in partnership with an international organization; the program included 10 participating families who received funding from the 284MADAGASCARgovernment, but the government did not report how many children it placed in foster families during the reporting period. The government continued to operate and fund the Manjary Soa Center in Antananarivo, which received 35 children who had been removed from situations of forced labor and sex trafficking. This center provided vocational training or reintegration into the public school system. The city of Antananarivo continued to manage an emergency center for child victims of domestic servitude, generally referred by PMPM; the city, in partnership with an international organization, provided food, lodging, psychological and medical aid, and educational services. The foreign ministry had the responsibility to systematically inform the Ministry of Population when victims were in the process of repatriation; in turn, the Ministry of Population would contact the victims upon their return and offer assistance, but reports indicated most victims were reluctant to work with the government to accept assistance. The 2014 anti-trafficking law required authorities to consider legal alternatives for foreign trafficking victims who believe they may face hardship or retribution if returned to their country of origin. There were no reports the government arrested or punished trafficking victims for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being subjected to trafficking; however, without formal national procedures to identify trafficking victims, some victims might have remained unidentified in the law enforcement system. The government would sometimes require the testimony of identified trafficking victims as a condition of using the police station as temporary shelter. To prevent retaliation from suspected traffickers, trafficking trials might be held in private or by camera for the sake of the victim or witness' confidentiality and privacy; however, the government did not report doing so in the reporting period. Further, while the 2014 anti-trafficking law entitled victims to restitution, for the fourth consecutive year, the government did not implement this provision. ","recommendation":"Increase efforts to convict suspected trafficking offenders, including complicit officials; develop formal procedures for, and provide training to officials on, proactive measures to identify victims, investigate cases, and refer victims to appropriate services; adequately fund the National Office to Combat Trafficking and relevant agencies supporting anti-trafficking efforts; implement the five-year national action plan to combat trafficking; replace the general suspension of recruitment agencies sending migrant workers abroad with strong regulations that are consistently enforced; negotiate an agreement between the government, training centers, and recruiters for prospective migrant workers; collaborate with destination country governments to protect Malagasy migrant workers and jointly address cases of abuse; increase efforts to raise public awareness of labor trafficking, including of adults subjected to forced labor; and, improve national level data 283MADAGASCARcollection on law enforcement efforts, distinguishing between trafficking and other crimes, including the number of victims identified, cases investigated and prosecuted, and the number of convictions.","tier":"TIER 2","traffick_profile":"As reported over the past five years, Madagascar is a source and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Malagasy children, mostly from rural and coastal regions, and from impoverished families in urban areas, are exploited in child sex trafficking, domestic servitude, and forced labor in mining, fishing, and agriculture across the country. The prevalence of child forced begging has increased in Antananarivo; reports indicated that children, including disabled children, are forced to work for long hours and in dangerous conditions, frequently at the behest of their parents. Most child sex trafficking occurs with the involvement and encouragement of family members; however, tourist operators, hotels, taxi drivers, massage centers, and local adults in prostitution also facilitate this crime. Some children are fraudulently recruited for work in Antananarivo as waitresses and masseuses before being exploited in child sex trafficking. Malagasy men exploit the majority of child sex trafficking victims. Reports suggest child sexual exploitation is also prevalent in tourist destinations and surrounding formal and informal mining sites. The majority of child sex tourists are French and Italian nationals, and to a lesser extent, other Westerners and Comorians. NGOs previously reported government officials' complicity in obtaining falsified national identity cards facilitates child sex trafficking in Madagascar and forced labor in domestic servitude of Malagasy women abroad. Previous reports indicated child sex trafficking of boys was becoming more prevalent. Forced labor persisted in the context of \ufb01dinas,\ufb02 which were informal arrangements for payment or in response to wrongdoing and a way of resolving confticts or paying debt; these arrangements persisted because authorities did not effectively enforce the law.Many Malagasy women are employed as domestic workers in Lebanon, Kuwait, China, and Saudi Arabia, and the media reports that informal placement agencies are still attempting to circumvent the 2013 ban against sending workers to the Middle East by routing them via Mauritius, Seychelles, Comoros, and Kenya using tourist visas. Malagasy women are sent by persons acting as informal placement agents to China with falsified identity cards and exploited in forced labor and sold as brides. Reports state that Malagasy men in the Middle East may endure forced labor in the service and construction sectors and may endure forced domestic servitude in China. Recently, migrant workers are increasingly targets for blackmail or solicitation of bribes, largely consequences of the suspension of accreditation of placement agencies. Reports indicate Malagasy workers in Lebanon are victims of various forms of abuse by their 285MALAWIemployers, such as physical violence and confiscation of passports, which might have been a factor in their subsequent imprisonment."},"Malawi":{"April":1.0,"Asylum Seekers":"3","August":0.0,"December":1.0,"February":0.0,"Friday":0.0,"Global Population":18143.22,"January":0.0,"July":0.0,"June":0.0,"Life Expectancy":63.8,"March":0.0,"May":0.0,"Monday":1.0,"November":1.0,"October":0.0,"Population below $1.90 a day":"70.3","Saturday":0.0,"September":0.0,"Sunday":1.0,"Thursday":0.0,"Tuesday":1.0,"Violence against civilians":3,"Wednesday":0.0,"fatalities":["1","0","0"],"government_effort":"NA","introduction":"The Government of Malawi does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so.

The government demonstrated increasing efforts by prosecuting and convicting 26 traffickers and handed down sentences ranging from 12 to 21 years imprisonment. It identified 121 trafficking victims and coordinated with a foreign government to repatriate two women who were exploited abroad. The government launched its anti-trafficking fund intended for victim services. The government also launched a five-year anti-trafficking national action plan and continued to conduct awareness-raising activities. However, the government did not meet the minimum standards in several key areas. The government did not always employ a victim-centered approach in the courtroom and continued to lack systematic procedures for the proactive identification of victims and their referral to care. In November 2016, a United States District Court for the District of Maryland issued a default judgment awarding more than $1 million in damages to a domestic worker who sued her former employer, a Malawian diplomat, for human trafficking; the diplomat left the United States in 2012. The diplomat did not pay the outstanding judgment nor did the government report taking any action during the reporting period to hold the diplomat accountable.

The National Coordination Committee, established under the anti-trafficking act that came into force in November 2015, met once during the reporting period. Members of the informal Malawi Network Against Child Trafficking, comprising government officials, NGOs, and international stakeholders, registered as an NGO and met several times during the reporting period. The government conducted awareness campaigns via various media outlets. The government continued to participate in the South African Development Community (SADC) regional data collection tool by uploading trafficking cases, victim and trafficker profiles, and sharing information with countries in the region. Through its participation in the data tool, UNODC and SADC launched the first annual draft analysis report for the region. The government implemented compulsory universal birth registration, by issuing chip-based national identification cards to more than 9 million citizens over 16 years of age and 4.5 million under the age of 15. The government did not conduct any labor inspections for the third consecutive year. However, after the government became aware of the exploitation of two Malawian women in Iraq, the Ministry of Labor issued a press release urging private employment agencies, the general public, and prospective economic migrants to familiarize themselves with the Labor Export Guidelines. Due to lack of funding, more than 60 percent of positions within the Ministry of Labor were vacant, impeding efforts to identify and penalize fraudulent labor recruitment during the year. The government did not demonstrate efforts to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts or forced labor. Malawi did not provide anti-trafficking training for its diplomatic personnel. With support and assistance from foreign entities, the government ensured Malawian troops received anti-trafficking training prior to their deployment abroad on international peacekeeping missions.","prosecution":"The government maintained robust law enforcement efforts. The 2015 Trafficking in Persons Act prohibited labor and sex trafficking and prescribed punishments of up to life imprisonment, without the option of fines. These penalties were sufficiently stringent, and with regard to sex trafficking, commensurate with punishments prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape.In 2017, the Malawi Police Service (MPS) reported anti-trafficking law enforcement data from seven of Malawi's 34 district-level police stations. MPS reported it arrested 42 suspects, prosecuted at least 26 alleged traffickers, and convicted 26; this is compared with 30 arrests and prosecutions, and 18 convicted during the previous reporting period. The government did not report sentencing data; however, according to media reports the courts sentenced two traffickers to 12 and 21 years imprisonment. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), which includes MPS and immigration officials, maintained primary responsibility for the prosecution of trafficking crimes and enforcement of trafficking laws. During the reporting period, a defendant who was self-representing was allowed to cross examine three girls aged 12, 13, and 14 who he exploited in sex trafficking in an open court with 60 onlookers in attendance. The MPS retained anti-trafficking training in its curricula for the Limbe, Mtakata, and Mlangeni Police Training Schools and Zomba Police College and human trafficking was a topic of continuing education lectures. The Department for Immigration trained an unknown number of new immigration officers on victim identification and assistance to potential trafficking victims. In partnership with an international organization, the government trained an unknown number of magistrates, prosecutors, immigration officers, police investigators, police victim support officers, roadblock officers, and community policing partners. MHA partnered with an international organization to establish cross-border forums with Mozambique, Zambia, and Tanzania, with which the government held monthly information exchanges between law enforcement officials. In November 2016, a United States District Court for the District of Maryland issued a default judgement awarding more than $1 million in damages to a domestic worker who sued her former employer, a former Malawian diplomat, for trafficking; the former diplomat left the United States in 2012. The diplomat did not pay the outstanding judgment nor did the government report taking any action during the reporting period to hold the diplomat accountable.","protection":"The government maintained inadequate protection efforts. The government continued to lack systematic procedures for the proactive identification of victims and their referral to care. Given severe resource constraints, the government relied largely on NGOs to provide long-term protective services. The government identified 121 trafficking victims, a decrease from 168 identified during the previous reporting period. Of those victims, 86 were adults and 35 were children; 29 victims were identified abroad in Kenya, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and South Africa. The majority of victims identified abroad were women. The government did not provide information on whether these victims were referred to protective services. The government launched in December 2017 its anti-trafficking fund, as required by the 2015 anti-trafficking law. The fund, intended to finance delivery of protective services, shelter refurbishment, and repatriation, has yet to be credited with the budgeted funds. The government did not report how much of 286MALAYSIAthis budget was actually dispersed during the reporting period. The government did not provide in-kind or financial support for most NGO services, including those offered at the only dedicated shelter for trafficking victims in the country, which was operated by an international NGO. The government ran one social rehabilitation center in Lilongwe for vulnerable children, orphans, and child trafficking and gender-based violence victims, providing counseling and rehabilitation services. Despite the establishment of the anti-trafficking fund, the center remained chronically underfunded and poor conditions reportedly led some child sex trafficking victims to leave the shelter and return to the brothels from which they had been removed. The lack of adequate and sustained assistance left victims vulnerable to re-trafficking. Some of the approximately 300 police sub-stations at the village level housed victim support units (VSUs) to respond to gender-based violence and trafficking crimes; however, the VSUs lacked capacity to respond adequately and the quality of services remained variable throughout the country. Some foreign victims avoided these centers due to fear of deportation. Malawian law does not provide foreign victims with temporary residency or other legal alternatives to removal to their countries of origin; foreign victims faced deportation unless they challenged their immigration status in court. The government coordinated with the Government of Iraq to repatriate two women who were exploited in Erbil. In 2017, there were no credible reports of trafficking victims being detained, fined, or jailed for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of their being subjected to trafficking; however, due to a lack of formal victim identification procedures during the reporting period, and the absence of alternatives to deportation for trafficking victims, some unidentified trafficking victims might have remained in the criminal justice system or been deported. ","recommendation":"Enter lists of enforcement and protection officers and shelters for trafficking victims in the official gazette in order for the law to be fully operational; fully implement the prosecution and protection provisions in the 2015 anti-trafficking law; vigorously prosecute and sentence both sex and labor trafficking offenses under the 2015 law; ensure all convicted traffickers receive jail time by consistently applying sufficiently stringent punishments; support training and increase funding for judges, prosecutors, labor inspectors, and police to identify, investigate, and prosecute trafficking crimes; develop formal guidelines to identify trafficking victims, especially among vulnerable populations, and refer them to available services; increase the availability of shelters and protection services for victims, including through in-kind or material support to NGOs for expansion of direct service provisions; improve and expand the collection of national prosecution and protection data; and increase awareness and monitoring of trafficking crimes, as well as efforts to identify traffickers and victims at border crossings and internal police checkpoints.","tier":"TIER 2","traffick_profile":"As reported over the past five years, Malawi is a source country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking. To a lesser extent, it is a destination country for men, women, and children from Zambia, Mozambique, the Great Lakes region, and the Horn of Africa who are subjected to labor and sex trafficking, and a transit country for people from these countries exploited in South Africa. Most Malawian trafficking victims are exploited within the country, generally transported from the southern part of the country to the central and northern regions for forced labor in agriculture (predominantly the tobacco industry), goat and cattle herding, and brickmaking. Many cases of child labor external to the family involve fraudulent recruitment and physical or sexual abuse, indicative of forced labor. Traffickers\u0160primarily facilitators or brothel owners\u0160typically lure children from their families in rural areas under pretenses of employment opportunities, clothing, or lodging for which they are sometimes charged exorbitant fees, resulting in sex trafficking coerced through debts. Traffickers subject teenage boys to forced labor on farms and young girls to sexual exploitation in nightclubs or bars. Children are subjected to forced labor in begging, small businesses, and potentially in the fishing industry; in past years, some were coerced to commit crimes. Adult tenant farmers are vulnerable to exploitation, as they incur debts to landowners and may not receive payment during poor harvests. Malawian victims of sex and labor trafficking have been identified in Mozambique, South Africa, Zambia, Kenya, and Tanzania, as well as Iraq, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia.

The government demonstrated significant efforts by convicting more traffickers, increasing criminal enforcement of unauthorized passport retention, granting more victims freedom of movement, tripling funding for NGOs including for three NGO-run shelters, and opening its first trafficking-specific court. The government also amended its foreign worker levy and Private Employment Agency Act to shift debt burdens away from migrant workers. However, the government did not demonstrate overall increasing efforts compared to the previous year. The government's victim protection efforts remained largely inadequate and the government identified fewer victims than the previous year. The Ministry of Human Resources drafted legislative changes that would cover domestic workers under employment laws, but the new regulations had not been approved by the Cabinet by the end of the reporting period, and recruitment practices 287MALAYSIAoften exposed foreign workers to debt bondage. Procedures to extend victims' freedom of movement and the right to work were impeded by bureaucratic delays, lack of appropriate staff, and risk-averse and paternalistic attitudes towards victims; of the 721 victims identified, the government granted two work visas and 91 special immigration passes for freedom of movement. Complicity among law enforcement officials hampered some anti-trafficking efforts; while authorities investigated these crimes, culpable officials typically avoided prosecution and punishment. No Malaysians, including suspected complicit officials, have been prosecuted for the possible trafficking crimes that were uncovered on the border of Thailand in 2015. The government prosecuted fewer suspected traffickers than the previous year. Therefore Malaysia was downgraded to Tier 2 Watch List.","iso3":"MYS","latitude":["3.0443","0.9752","5.7755","5.7755","4.779","5.3428","2.7123","1.8548","3.1412","4.779"],"location":["Klang","Kampung Danau Melikin","Pegasus Reef","Pegasus Reef","Southeastern Coast of Sabah","Kuala Terengganu","Seremban","Batu Pahat","Kuala Lumpur","Southeastern Coast of Sabah"],"longitude":["101.4444","110.8059","118.8402","118.8402","118.618","103.0993","101.9019","102.9325","101.6865","118.618"],"notes":"In December 2018, a transgender woman was beaten to death in Klang, a Kuala Lumpur by an unidentified person. On 11 Dec 2018, near Kampung Danau Melikin, Sarawak, two members of the Indonesian army kidnapped at gunpoint, abused and threatened to kill five Sarawakians while they were harvesting wood in the Wong Rangkai forest on the Malaysian side of the border. The soldiers accused them of stealing Indonesian wood and they were only released after family members paid a ransom. On 6 December 2018, near Pegasus Reef, near Sabah, four gunmen on a speedboat opened fire at a tugboat, hitting its skipper. The attackers boarded the Magtrans II tugboat, but the wounded crew fired parachute signal rockets at the gunmen who quickly fled. On 5 December 2018, near Pegasus Reef, three Indonesian fishing crew were reported kidnapped by Abu Sayyaf gunmen off Sabah near the Philippine border and were taken to the southern province of Sulu On 11 September 2018, two Indonesian fishermen were kidnapped by the Abu Sayyaf group off the coast of Semporna town (Tawau, Sabah) and brought to Sulu. One of those captured was later released on 5 December 2018. On 3 September 2018, two Muslim women were found guilty of attempting lesbian sex in a car and were publicly caned in front of 100 people at the Sharia High Court in Kuala Terengganu city (KT, Teren). On 15 August 2018, five men attacked and injured a transgender person with pieces of wood and PVC plastic pipes at Jalan A. S. Tambaiyah 3 in Seremban city (Serem, NS). On 1 May 2018, an opposition supporter (PKR) punched and pushed a 74-year-old Barisan Nasional supporter off a stage in Batu Pahat city (BP, Johor) after a misunderstanding about party flags. On 21 April 2018, in Kuala Lumpur city (KL, FTKL), a Palestinian lecturer and member of Hamas was shot dead on his way to dawn prayers by two unidentified men on a motorbike. On 22 February 2018, a fishing boat was targeted by five unidentified armed men, with the skipper and a crew four being shot at in the waters off of Segama, a region in Sabah near Lahad Datu city (Tawau, Sabah). The fishermen escaped any harm. Motives are unclear.","prevention":"The government increased efforts to prevent trafficking. The home affairs ministry headed the anti-trafficking council (MAPO), which included five enforcement bodies, other government entities, and three NGOs. It met on a quarterly basis and was active in coordinating interagency anti-trafficking efforts and conducting trainings for government ministries, in addition to consultation sessions with NGO partners to strengthen victim protection. In 2017, the government maintained its allocation of 4 million ringgits ($989,120) to operate the MAPO secretariat. The government continued implementing 289MALDIVESthe national action plan spanning 2016-2020, making progress towards improved cooperation with civil society, integrated action among law enforcement agencies, and increased focus on combating labor trafficking. The government produced and aired 9,006 public service radio broadcasts and 1,605 television segments during the reporting period, compared to 6,492 and 1,648 announcements, respectively, in 2016. It also consulted with civil society to create and publish a new informational booklet for employers of domestic workers. The government printed 2,000 booklets in English and Bahasa Malaysia for distribution to new employers. Labor officials also provided banners and other signage at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport in holding lounges for newly arrived migrant workers in a range of languages to help educate foreign workers about their rights in Malaysia. MAPO partnered with Malaysia Airlines on a human trafficking awareness campaign, kicked off with a three-day exhibition at Kuala Lumpur International Airport. UNHCR and a local NGO mapped stateless people in peninsular Malaysia and submitted nationality applications to reduce vulnerability to trafficking by providing identity documents. In response, the government granted citizenship to 2,168 persons and continued processing the remaining 10,000 applications during the reporting period.The government strengthened its enforcement of the law against unauthorized passport retention by initiating 70 prosecutions and obtaining 41 convictions of employers who contravened the Malaysian Passport Act of 1966 (17 in 2016). The government also implemented two improvements to labor laws to eliminate conditions that often lead foreign workers into debt bondage. The first improvement required employers to pay the foreign worker levy for any non-Malaysians they hired, instead of forcing workers to bear the costs. The government also amended the Private Employment Agency Act to significantly increase the penalties for violating recruitment laws and to require all recruitment agencies to get a special license from the Ministry of Human Resources to recruit foreign workers, including domestic workers. Employment law continued to exclude domestic workers from a number of protections, including the country's minimum wage. Labor inspectorates conducted 40,869 labor inspections, which resulted in the issuance of 5,257 correction notices, a slight decrease compared to 49,610 labor inspections and 5,297 correction notices in 2016. Labor courts resolved 12,498 labor disputes and ordered employers to provide exploited workers back wages of more than 64 million ringgits ($15.8 million) and levied fines of 979,000 ringgits ($246,090) for non-compliant employers. The government did not demonstrate efforts to reduce demand for commercial sex. The government provided anti-trafficking training for its diplomatic personnel and its troops prior to their deployment abroad on international peacekeeping missions.","prosecution":"The government demonstrated uneven law enforcement efforts. The 2007 Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act\u0160amended in 2010 and 2015\u0160criminalized labor and sex trafficking and prescribed punishments of up to 20 years imprisonment, which were sufficiently stringent and, with respect to sex trafficking, commensurate with those prescribed for other serious offenses, such as rape. The government conducted 556 trafficking and trafficking-related investigations in 2017, compared to 581 investigations in 2016 and 158 in 2015. The government initiated prosecutions against 80 alleged traffickers, compared to 175 initiated in 2016 and 38 in 2015. The government convicted 45 traffickers\u0160including 13 for forced labor\u0160under the anti-trafficking act, representing the highest number of convictions achieved annually, and compared to 35 in 2016 and seven in 2015. The government sentenced 25 traffickers to imprisonment ranging between 15 months and 12 years. Eleven traffickers received prison sentences ranging between one day and six months, while 12 traffickers received only fines.In March 2018, the government established an anti-trafficking court beginning in the state of Selangor, which historically had the highest number of trafficking cases. In its first month, the court expedited 12 trafficking cases in an existing court by setting aside a few hours a week for senior, experienced judges to focus on trafficking cases. The majority of prosecutors engaged with victims at least two weeks prior to trial to better understand and address victims' concerns about the inner workings of trials; however, limited availability of certified interpreters and Malaysia's decentralized jurisdictions made it difficult for officials to meet with all victims. The government expanded the mandate of the interagency law enforcement task force and made it permanent. The government provided new office space for the 17-member interagency group. The task force successfully conducted six operations focused on forced labor in 2017. The Royal Malaysia Police continued to serve as the lead enforcement agency under the anti-trafficking act and maintained a specialized anti-trafficking unit comprising 242 officers posted throughout the country. The labor department's specialized trafficking enforcement team increased the number of officers to 34, from 30. The attorney general's chambers appointed two additional trafficking-specialist deputy public prosecutors throughout Malaysia, raising the total to 54. The government continued to conduct or support anti-trafficking trainings, including 34 in-service trainings for police officials and 14 transnational or bilateral trainings in the region focusing on victim protection, law enforcement, and prosecution, among other topics. Labor inspectors received eight trafficking-focused training sessions. During the year, a total of 40 prosecutors at the attorney general's chambers participated in four trafficking-related training programs.The 2015 discoveries of migrant camps and mass graves along the border with Thailand fueled reports that corrupt officials facilitated migrant smuggling, which may have included trafficking crimes committed in 2015. The media published a report in December 2017 alleging official misconduct and claiming law enforcement officials conducted a previously undisclosed raid in January 2015; the government reported it 288MALAYSIAdid not reveal the details of the case since it was an ongoing investigation. In 2016, investigations into these camps and graves yielded four migrant smuggling convictions in Malaysia; no Malaysian nationals were among those convicted. The government reported the investigations remained ongoing, and Malaysia and Thailand continued to cooperate in the search for additional suspects. No new charges have been brought and to date no Malaysian national\u0160public official or private citizen\u0160has been prosecuted for alleged trafficking crimes associated with these camps and graves.Complicity among law enforcement officials, in the form of accepting bribes to allow undocumented border crossings, hampered some anti-trafficking efforts. The government uncovered four smuggling networks operating at Kuala Lumpur International Airport; the immigration director reassigned 600 officials and investigations remained ongoing at the close of the reporting period. Separately, authorities investigated 18 for human smuggling and trafficking in persons and prosecuted two officers for exploitation of their domestic employees (unrelated to their official duties); all cases remained ongoing at the end of the reporting period. In 2016, the government prosecuted five officials for corruption in the form of accepting bribes to allow undocumented border crossings; four were found guilty for smuggling offenses while the fifth official was acquitted.","protection":"The government maintained protection efforts. Law enforcement agencies followed standardized procedures to identify trafficking victims. Identification of labor trafficking cases continued to rely on labor inspections in response to workers' complaints of non-payment of wages and other violations. In 2017, the government identified 2,224 potential trafficking victims nationwide and confirmed 721 victims, compared to 3,411 potential trafficking victims and 1,558 confirmed victims in 2016. Both years represented a marked increase over the 305 victims confirmed in 2015. Enforcement agencies employed the anti-trafficking law broadly by presuming as potential trafficking victims all foreign women during bar or massage parlor roundups. The government shifted significant resources toward forced labor, compared to a previous focus primarily on sex trafficking, partially explaining the decrease in the overall number of victims identified. The government did not proactively screen the vulnerable migrant worker population for indicators of trafficking, which left an unknown number of potential victims without proper care. The anti-trafficking law provided trafficking victims immunity from immigration-related offenses, such as illegal entry, unlawful presence, and possession of fraudulent travel documents. The government sometimes detained, deported, or charged with immigration offenses potential victims who denied they had been subjected to trafficking or when employers confiscated their documents.Amendments to the anti-trafficking law allowed victims to work and to move freely in and out of government facilities, pending a security risk assessment, medical screening, and mental health evaluation. Of the 721 victims identified, the government issued 91 special immigration passes that would authorize freedom of movement, compared to 12 passes in 2016. However, in practice, authorities sometimes limited movement outside the shelter to occasional trips with a chaperone, two to three times a month. The government issued two work visas to victims, compared to six issued the previous year. Despite government efforts to provide legal employment for victims, government shelter staff reported the majority of eligible participants declined to participate in the program, citing a preference to return home. The government commenced monthly allowance payments of 127 ringgits ($31) to victims for incidental expenditures, and by March 2018, 273 victims received a total of 96,320 ringgits ($23,820). The government did not disburse the funds on a monthly basis, and victims received the allowance as a lump sum when they repatriated home.The government housed most victims in government facilities as part of a court-ordered 21-day interim protection order (for suspected trafficking victims) or a subsequent 90-day protection order (for certified trafficking victims). Some victims, however, remained in the shelters for up to six months. Shelters sometimes became temporarily over-crowded following increased police efforts to identify victims. The government took steps to reduce shelter overcrowding by providing 80 percent of the funding for three new NGO-run shelters in Kuala Lumpur, Sabah, and Penang; however, the shelters remained underutilized due to bureaucratic obstacles and authorities approved only a small number of victims for transfer to these shelters during the reporting period. Most victims who stayed in government shelters did so without freedom of movement or the right to work, in contravention of global best practices. As in past years, many victims preferred to return immediately to their home countries. Although the law permits victims to testify remotely, authorities generally expected victims to remain in-country pending trial proceedings. During the reporting period, many victims were unwilling to testify. The reluctance of victims to provide witness testimony reportedly stemmed from a desire to avoid protracted criminal proceedings and to quickly rejoin the informal workforce, unappealing shelter and work conditions, and bribes or intimidation from traffickers. The Ministry of Women, Family, and Community Development maintained seven facilities specifically to house trafficking victims\u0160four for women, one for men, and two for children. During the reporting period, the government allocated 5.6 million ringgits ($1.4 million) to operate its shelters, including funds to open three new trafficking shelters in the states of Kedah, Kelantan, and Sarawak. The government provided basic services for all victims staying in its facilities, including food, shelter, medical care, social and religious activities, and security; NGOs provided some victim rehabilitation and counseling services in most shelters, typically without government-allocated funding. After an initial 21-day period when authorities did not permit victims any communication with persons outside the shelter, victims could make a phone call once per month, and shelter staff provided opportunities for victims to engage in handicrafts and other income-generating activities. In general, NGOs expressed difficulty in maintaining adequate resources and staffing levels to provide consistent services for victims. Overall, the government tripled its funding for NGOs this year, increasing from 483,000 ringgits ($119,440) in 2016 to 1.4 million ringgits ($341,250) to conduct various programs and activities with shelter residents.","recommendation":"Significantly increase the number of trafficking victims who obtain approval for freedom of movement; expand freedom of movement allowed of victims in shelters to include unchaperoned movement and at-will communication with people outside shelter facilities; increase the number of trafficking victims who obtain approval for employment; improve implementation of regulations for the 2015 amendments to the anti-trafficking law and formally establish procedures that ensure security assessments are designed to mitigate safety and security concerns of individual victims rather than risk to the shelter or government; increase the number of trafficking prosecutions and convictions, including of complicit officials and forced labor crimes; reduce court delays and increase judicial familiarity with the full range of trafficking crimes, particularly forced labor; make public the results of investigations involving corrupt officials to increase transparency and deterrence and hold officials criminally accountable when they violate the law; provide greater protection against debt bondage to foreign workers during the worker recruitment process; increase law enforcement capacity to investigate and prosecute trafficking cases based on intelligence gathering and information-sharing among government agencies; increase the capacity of labor inspectors to identify trafficking victims among vulnerable groups, such as migrant workers, and to effectively investigate labor trafficking; expand labor protections for domestic workers and investigate allegations of domestic worker abuse; improve case management and communication with trafficking victims, including through increased prosecutor-victim interaction at least two weeks prior to trial in compliance with the attorney general's directive; strengthen collaboration with credible and effective NGOs and implement plans to provide more services for victims, including the construction of new or expansion of existing shelters; expand efforts to inform workers, including domestic workers, of their rights to maintain access to their passports at any time, without delay or approval, and without consequence to their status and relationship with their employer, and include language explicitly stating passports will remain in the employee's possession in model contracts and future bilateral memoranda of understanding with labor source countries; effectively enforce the law prohibiting employers from retaining passports without employees' consent, educate workers and employers on foreign worker rights, including legal recourses and remedies against traffickers, and ensure employers provide lockers or other secure passport storage facilities; and fully implement the 2016-2020 national plan to combat trafficking.","tier":"TIER 2 WATCH LIST","traffick_profile":"As reported over the past five years, Malaysia is a destination and, to a much lesser extent, source and transit country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and women and children subjected to sex trafficking. The overwhelming majority of victims are among the estimated two million documented and an even greater number of undocumented migrant laborers in Malaysia. Foreign workers constitute more than 20 percent of the Malaysian workforce and typically migrate voluntarily\u0160often illegally\u0160from Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Burma, Indonesia, the Philippines, and other Asian countries. Employers, employment agents, and informal labor recruiters subject some migrants to forced labor or debt bondage when they are unable to pay the fees for recruitment and associated travel. Outsourcing or contract labor companies may not have oversight of personnel issues or day-to-day working conditions, leading to heightened vulnerabilities to exploitative labor conditions and a reduced ability to resolve disputes for foreign workers. Agents in labor source countries may impose onerous fees on workers before they arrive in Malaysia, and additional administrative fees after arrival in some cases cause debt bondage. Large organized crime syndicates are responsible for some instances of trafficking. Official complicity and corruption among immigration and police officers remains a problem and impedes some efforts to address trafficking. NGOs made credible accusations of complicity among some Malaysian law enforcement agencies, including immigration officials who reportedly accept bribes to allow undocumented border crossings. Discoveries of migrant camps and mass graves along the border with Thailand in 2015 and media reporting in December 2017 generated reports some officials were complicit in facilitating migrant smuggling, which may have included trafficking crimes; however, no Malaysian official (or national) was held criminally accountable.Some migrant workers on palm oil and agricultural plantations, at construction sites, in the electronics and garment industries, and in homes as domestic workers are subjected to practices that can indicate forced labor, such as passport retention, contract violations, restricted movement, wage fraud, and imposition of significant debts by recruitment agents or employers. Contract violations remain widespread in Malaysia. Passport retention remained widespread and problematic; Malaysian law allows employers to hold workers' passports with the workers' permission, but it is difficult to determine if workers have freely given permission, and some employers may retain the passports to prevent workers from changing jobs. In efforts to circumvent anti-trafficking protections established by the Indonesian government, some Indonesian workers may transit Malaysia legally en route to Middle Eastern countries, where traffickers exploit some into forced labor. Although significantly fewer than the number of forced laborers, some young foreign women\u0160mainly from Southeast Asia\u0160are recruited ostensibly for legal work in Malaysian restaurants, hotels, and beauty salons, but are instead forced or coerced into prostitution. Traffickers force some women and girls into prostitution through brokered marriages. The more than 152,000 registered refugees and asylum-seekers in Malaysia lack formal status and the ability to obtain legal work permits, leaving them vulnerable to trafficking. Many refugees incur large smuggling debts, which traffickers use to subject some refugees to debt bondage. Traffickers exploit Malaysian orphans and children from refugee communities for forced begging. The number of internal Malaysian victims, including child victims, is increasing due to the additional focus on labor trafficking."},"Mali":{"April":18.0,"Asylum Seekers":"15","August":10.0,"December":32.0,"February":13.0,"Friday":27.0,"Global Population":19077.75,"January":4.0,"July":31.0,"June":21.0,"Life Expectancy":58.89,"March":21.0,"May":33.0,"Monday":41.0,"November":29.0,"October":32.0,"Population below $1.90 a day":"49.7","Saturday":37.0,"September":20.0,"Sunday":51.0,"Thursday":42.0,"Tuesday":29.0,"Violence against civilians":264,"Wednesday":37.0,"fatalities":["0","0","2","0","9","0","0","1","0","6","1","0","1","1","0","0","0","1","12","6","21","7","0","21","4","6","7","15","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","9","2","0","3","1","2","1","32","1","3","0","4","1","2","1","4","5","0","0","4","0","2","2","0","1","3","0","1","1","6","0","1","0","2","1","0","9","0","2","12","4","1","1","3","1","0","2","0","1","0","0","1","6","8","1","0","11","0","4","0","27","2","2","1","0","0","0","0","1","3","1","10","5","2","0","10","4","1","7","0","0","1","0","1","14","3","1","0","0","0","0","3","0","1","0","0","0","0","17","0","1","0","0","3","2","12","0","1","0","0","0","4","4","5","3","13","16","2","3","0","0","3","32","7","1","0","10","3","1","2","12","13","3","3","1","1","8","1","0","0","0","5","2","3","3","2","12","1","0","0","0","0","1","1","1","10","0","10","0","0","0","6","0","9","1","2","6","2","2","11","6","1","4","1","3","2","2","31","0","2","0","0","6","0","1","0","0","0","0","2","0","0","0","1","0","1","0","0","6","1","2","2","2","2","0","10","2","2","1","4","0","1","7","1","0","0","0","0","2","4","5","0","3","0","0","1","0"],"government_effort":"NA","introduction":"The Government of Mali does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. The government made key achievements during the reporting period; therefore Mali was upgraded to Tier 2 Watch List.

Despite these achievements, the government did not make significant efforts to address child soldiering. The government provided support to and collaborated with the Imghad Tuareg and Allies Self-Defense Group (GATIA), a non-governmental armed group headed by a Malian general that used and recruited child soldiers, at times by force. The government did not investigate any suspects, including government officials, for child soldiering offenses or make efforts to prevent armed groups from using and recruiting children.

Of the 13 suspects prosecuted\u0160primarily Quranic school teachers for alleged child forced begging\u0160the government convicted and sentenced one offender to eight months imprisonment and acquitted five additional suspects, although prosecutors were appealing these rulings. There were seven ongoing prosecutions at the end of the reporting period.The Ministry of Justice trained more than 300 judges, magistrates, and police in five of Mali's eight regions on victim identification and investigations and prosecutions under the 2012 law, and distributed 200 copies of the law in all 13 national languages. Despite these efforts, continued lack of awareness of the 2012 law stymied law enforcement action; for example, judges dismissed cases against at least three alleged traffickers for forced begging because judges were unfamiliar with the 2012 law. Additionally, the police's system-wide lack of funding and resources, including vehicles and equipment to investigate crimes, impeded anti-trafficking efforts. Due to continuing security concerns, the government had limited or no judicial presence in four of the country's eight regions, primarily in the north and center of the country. The government continued the investigation from the previous reporting period of a former diplomat from Democratic Republic of the Congo and two Malian police officers for allegedly facilitating the transportation of Congolese girls to African, European, and Asian countries for exploitation. The non-governmental armed group GATIA, led by a Malian general, used and recruited child soldiers during the reporting period, but the government did not report any investigations, prosecutions, or convictions of traffickers, including complicit officials, for child soldiering offenses. ","protection":"The government maintained efforts to identify and protect trafficking victims. Government officials and NGO partners identified 104 trafficking victims and 43 potential trafficking victims during the reporting period, including Malians exploited in Mali and abroad and foreigners exploited in Mali. This is compared to the government and NGOs identifying 143 potential trafficking victims the previous reporting period. Among the potential victims, authorities identified 41 Nigerian sex trafficking victims (36 women and five girls), 40 children in forced begging, and 23 child soldiers; the remainder included those exploited in unknown forms of trafficking and those vulnerable to exploitation. The government did not report identifying any victims of hereditary slavery. The government did not have standardized mechanisms to identify trafficking victims. The government worked closely with RAFY, a national network composed of NGOs; international organizations; and government ministries, including the Ministry for the Advancement of Women, Children, and the Family (MFFE), to refer all identified trafficking victims to service providers. While in some cases police denied assistance to trafficking victims if they did not file police reports against their traffickers, NGOs\u0160with some government assistance\u0160assisted all trafficking victims identified during the reporting period. Services varied by location but generally included shelter, food, counseling, vocational training, repatriation, and reintegration assistance. Most service providers were NGOs, and the government relied on these NGOs to provide the majority of services, funded by private and international donors. With funding from the national anti-trafficking committee, however, the government provided in-kind support, including furniture to NGO shelters. MFFE had general care facilities that could assist trafficking victims, although it did not report if they assisted any trafficking victims during the reporting period. Shelters and services for victims outside the capital remained limited, especially in the north. Foreign and domestic victims received the same services, and while some facilities could offer specialized services for females, there were no such services for males. The government issued travel documents and provided logistical coordination to facilitate the repatriation of at least 52 foreigners exploited in Mali. In collaboration with NGOs, MFFE also coordinated repatriation for Malian nationals exploited abroad and food, shelter, and medical assistance upon repatriation. The government provided monetary assistance to some Malian trafficking victims repatriated from Libya. The government referred victims to and provided security for an internationally run transit center for children separated from armed groups, including ex-child combatants. The National Directorate for the Advancement of Children and Families provided interim care, including medical and rehabilitation services, when victims could not be immediately placed at the transit center and assisted with family reunification. The center assisted at least 11 children during the reporting period. The government did not offer legal alternatives to removal to countries in which victims would face retribution or hardship, and it did not have formal policies to encourage victims to participate in trials against their traffickers. Victims could file civil suits against their traffickers, but the government did not 293MALTAreport that any did so during the reporting period. Malian law protected victims from being fined, detained, or otherwise penalized for crimes committed as a result of being subjected to trafficking; however, at least three children remained in state-run detention facilities for association with armed groups because the government considered them to be adults; some of the children had been in detention since April 2015. This was a decrease from seven children detained the previous reporting period. In at least 13 other cases, authorities followed the government's 2013 inter-ministerial protocol requiring them to direct former child soldiers to rehabilitation centers.","recommendation":" As part of the peace process, engage with non-governmental armed groups to cease recruitment and use of children; cease support to armed groups that recruit and use children; vigorously investigate and prosecute trafficking offenses and convict and punish traffickers, including complicit officials, with sentences prescribed in the 2012 law; provide care to all trafficking victims, 292MALIirrespective of their participation in criminal proceedings; follow the established protocol for referring children allegedly associated with armed groups to care, and release any children inappropriately detained; train and equip law enforcement on effective case investigation techniques; further train judges and prosecutors on the 2012 law; continue to provide funding or in-kind support to NGOs that assist trafficking victims; develop and train officials on standardized mechanisms to identify trafficking victims; finalize the draft anti-trafficking national action plan, including formalizing the roles of anti-trafficking committee members; expand and strengthen implementation of programs for the disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration of former child combatants that address specific needs of child ex-combatants; and increase efforts to raise public awareness of trafficking, including child forced begging and child soldiering.","tier":"TIER 2 WATCH LIST","traffick_profile":"As reported over the past five years, Mali is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking. Humanitarian actors report high unemployment, food insecurity, and security threats drive some families to sell their children into domestic servitude or forced labor in gold mines. Internal trafficking is more prevalent than transnational trafficking. Boys from Mali, Guinea, and Burkina Faso are subjected to forced labor in agriculture\u0160especially rice production\u0160artisanal gold mines, domestic work, transportation, begging, and the informal commercial sector. Malian boys are also forced to beg or perform agricultural work by unscrupulous Quranic teachers in neighboring countries, including Senegal and Guinea. Some members of Mali's black Tuareg community are subjected to slavery practices rooted in traditional relationships of hereditary servitude. Men and boys, primarily of Songhai ethnicity, were subjected to a long-standing practice of debt bondage in the salt mines of Taoudeni in northern Mali. NGO reports indicate Malian children endure forced labor on cotton and cocoa farms in Cote d'Ivoire. Malian women and girls are victims of sex trafficking in Gabon, Libya, Lebanon, and Tunisia and domestic servitude in Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and Tunisia. Women and girls from other West African countries, particularly Nigeria and Benin, are recruited with promises of jobs as nurses or waitresses in Bamako but exploited in sex trafficking throughout Mali, including in Chinese-run hotels and especially in small mining communities. Nigerian authorities estimate more than 5,000 Nigerian girls are victims of sex trafficking in Mali. Traffickers force women and girls into domestic servitude, agricultural labor, and support roles in artisanal gold mines. Reports allege corruption and complicity among local police and gendarmes in Farako may have facilitated forced labor and sex trafficking in mining communities. Africans transiting Mali to Europe, primarily via Algeria and Libya and less so via Mauritania, are vulnerable to trafficking, and Nigerian traffickers exploit Nigerian women in sex trafficking in Mali en route to Europe. An international organization repatriated more than 1,430 Malians from Libya in 2017, some of whom may have been trafficking victims.During the reporting period, the government did not exercise control over the majority of its territory and lost ground it had previously regained. Justice officials had no or an extremely limited presence in four of Mali's eight regions, limiting the government's ability to provide justice, victim services, and gather data. Since early 2012, rebel and Islamic extremist groups have occupied parts of northern Mali. Terrorist organizations and armed groups continue to recruit and use children, mostly boys, in combat, requiring children to carry weapons, staff checkpoints, guard prisoners, and conduct patrols; some used boys for running errands and spying. Some of these groups have also used girls in combat, support roles, and for sexual exploitation, including sexual slavery through forced marriages to members of these militias. The armed groups purportedly force some families to sell their children to the groups or coerced communities into giving up teenage boys to the groups for \ufb01community protection.\ufb02 An international organization reported traffickers fraudulently recruited some children for education in Quranic schools but forced them to fight with armed groups. Some poor families reportedly insert their children into the ranks of armed groups because parents believe they will benefit from disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration assistance. In the past, a Malian armed group forcibly recruited Malian refugees in Mauritania to be child soldiers in Mali. The government provided in-kind support to and collaborated with GATIA, a non-governmental armed group led by a Malian general that used and recruited at least nine children during the reporting period. In 2016, an international organization investigated GATIA officials, Malian Defense and Security Forces officers, and civilians for conftict-related sexual violence, including forced prostitution and sexual slavery."},"Mauritania":{"April":0.0,"Asylum Seekers":"8","August":0.0,"December":0.0,"February":0.0,"Friday":0.0,"Global Population":4403.31,"January":0.0,"July":0.0,"June":0.0,"Life Expectancy":64.7,"March":0.0,"May":0.0,"Monday":1.0,"November":0.0,"October":1.0,"Population below $1.90 a day":"6","Saturday":0.0,"September":0.0,"Sunday":0.0,"Thursday":0.0,"Tuesday":0.0,"Violence against civilians":1,"Wednesday":0.0,"fatalities":["0"],"government_effort":"NA","introduction":"The Government of Mauritania does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so; therefore Mauritania remained on Tier 3.

However, authorities penalized trafficking victims, continued to prevent certain anti-slavery activists from operating within the country, and increased harassment of anti-slavery activists. Government agencies charged with combating trafficking and slavery continued to lack the resources, personnel, and political will to prosecute politically-connected offenders, and reports persisted of officials refusing to investigate or prosecute perpetrators. Despite an increase in convictions, there remained a fundamental lack of commitment to combat hereditary slavery and other forms of human trafficking.

No single government agency was responsible for leading national anti-trafficking efforts. The inter-ministerial anti-trafficking committee, which reported to the prime minister, met twice during the reporting period to oversee implementation of the 2014-2017 roadmap to fight the vestiges of slavery, an action plan drafted in collaboration with an international organization. The Commission for Human Rights conducted a public workshop to showcase its draft 2016-2020 anti-trafficking national action plan but did not finalize it for the second consecutive year; it continued to review the draft in collaboration with international organizations. Tadamoun opened five new schools in communities of former slaves and continued to provide income-generating activities in poverty-stricken areas, focusing particularly on communities of slave descendants and groups vulnerable to exploitation. The government organized two slavery awareness campaigns outside of Nouakchott. The government continued to harass and prevent anti-slavery activists from operating in Mauritania; it denied entry into the country to two prominent human rights organizations and denied a national NGO authorization to conduct anti-slavery trainings for gendarmes, who were responsible for identifying and investigating trafficking cases in the country's interior. The government did not make efforts to reduce the demand for forced labor or commercial sex acts. Despite large groups of Mauritanians fraudulently recruited for work abroad, the government did not make efforts to oversee labor recruitment or investigate labor recruiters or brokers allegedly involved in fraudulent recruitment. The government signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Saudi Arabia to increase protections for prospective domestic workers, although it did not implement it during the reporting period and denied requests to consult with civil society organizations on implementation. The government did not provide anti-trafficking training to its diplomatic personnel. The government, in partnership with foreign donors, provided Mauritanian troops with anti-trafficking training prior to their deployment abroad as part of international peacekeeping missions.","prosecution":"The government made uneven anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts. The 2003 Law Against Trafficking in Persons criminalized sex and labor trafficking, except hereditary slavery, and prescribed penalties of five to 10 years imprisonment, which were sufficiently stringent and, with respect to sex trafficking, commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. The 2015 anti-slavery law criminalized hereditary slavery and prescribed sufficiently stringent penalties of five to 20 years imprisonment. The government investigated 19 suspects in three cases and prosecuted and convicted three slaveholders, a slight increase from one investigation, two prosecutions, and two convictions the previous reporting period. The government also continued 15 investigations from previous reporting periods, although their statuses were unclear. In one case, Mauritanian police and an international organization arrested 15 Quranic school teachers, known as marabouts, for child forced begging. The prosecutor declined to press charges and released the marabouts when they promised not to force the children to beg. International authorities reported the same children were begging in the streets after the marabouts' release, but the government did 297MAURITANIAnot take any further action. Three regional anti-slavery courts had exclusive jurisdiction over trafficking and slavery cases; however, the courts lacked the staff, funding, and resources to investigate and prosecute trafficking and slavery crimes throughout their regions. The three courts received a total of 4.5 million Mauritanian ouiguya [all amounts shown in the Dec. 31, 2017 MRO ouiguya] MRO ($12,670) during the reporting period, although the government had announced a budget of 7,000,000 MRO ($20,000), and none of the appointed judges were specifically trained to address the unique challenges of investigating slavery cases, including how to prevent slaveholders from intimidating victims and victims from withdrawing their cases. Moreover, while other topical courts had specialized prosecutors, there were no specialized prosecutors for the anti-slavery courts. Despite these limitations, the Nouadhibou court heard and completed its first two slavery cases since its inception in 2016 and convicted three slaveholders. In the first case, one slaveholder received a sentence of 10 years imprisonment and a fine. In the second case, one father, now deceased, and his son, who had fted Mauritania prior to the trial, were sentenced to 20 years imprisonment and a fine. These sentences were significantly higher than in the previous reporting period, when judges sentenced two slaveholders to five years imprisonment with four years suspended. The Nouakchott anti-slavery court had never heard a slavery case. The Ministry of Justice directed all courts to transfer cases under the 2003 anti-trafficking and 2015 anti-slavery laws to the anti-slavery courts; judges transferred 13 slavery cases, but at least four slavery cases remained with local courts. The government did not report information on the additional 29 investigations that were ongoing at the close of the previous reporting period. NGOs reported trafficking and slavery victims had begun to file complaints with international courts due to a lack of faith in the Mauritanian judiciary. NGOs reported the government did not initiate any investigations into fraudulent recruitment or continue the investigation initiated in 2016 into a recruitment agency that had allegedly fraudulently recruited more than 200 Mauritanian women to Saudi Arabia for domestic servitude and forced prostitution; NGOs alleged the case was closed and the agency continued to operate. In a second case, a Mauritanian domestic servitude victim in Saudi Arabia attempted to file a complaint against her employer, but the Mauritanian embassy reportedly refused to assist. At the close of the reporting period, an NGO within Mauritania had filed a complaint on her behalf, as well as on behalf of approximately 20 other Mauritanian women exploited in domestic servitude and forced prostitution in Saudi Arabia. Efforts to address hereditary slavery remained weak. Despite serious concerns of official complicity and corruption in slavery cases, the government did not report any prosecutions or convictions of government officials complicit in human trafficking offenses. Some police, prosecutors, and judges reportedly refused to investigate and try cases of hereditary slavery. Heavy government inftuence over the judiciary restricted its independence, and reports persisted that prosecutors and judges often prosecuted alleged slave owners for lesser offenses to avoid bringing a slavery case to trial. However, Tadamoun remained a civil party to seven ongoing slavery investigations. During the reporting period, two former slaves appealed to the African Union the lenient sentence given to their former slaveholder in 2011. After the verdict in 2011, the prosecution had appealed the lenient sentence and the defendant had appealed the verdict; the defendant was released pending the appeal, and the judiciary had not taken any further action on the case in the last seven years. In December 2017, the African Union ruled the government had failed to adequately enforce its anti-slavery law, had not duly compensated the victims, and had given too lenient of a sentence to the convicted slaveholder. It further ruled that by failing to fully investigate or prevent cases of slavery, authorities had created a culture of impunity for trafficking. In coordination with NGOs, the government co-led two trainings on the anti-trafficking legal framework for judges and prosecutors.","protection":"The government maintained minimal efforts to protect trafficking victims. The government reported identifying 35 child forced begging victims\u016020 Mauritanian children and 15 children from neighboring countries\u0160a significant decrease from the previous reporting period, when police identified more than 649 child slavery and trafficking victims. The government did not have formal measures to identify trafficking victims or refer them to care, but it used existing referral procedures for child victims of crime. NGOs noted social workers lacked training to identify trafficking victims, including in domestic work and prostitution, and where to refer them for care. One NGO assisted, including with repatriation, 44 Mauritanian women exploited abroad in forced prostitution. The NGO also identified a Mauritanian man in debt bondage abroad, but neither his alleged trafficker nor the destination government provided authorization for him to return to Mauritania; he remained in debt bondage at the close of the reporting period. NGOs reported caring for 4,616 vulnerable children during the reporting period, which included child victims of violence, abuse, and exploitation, including trafficking. Some of the children received socio-legal assistance, medical care, and educational support from NGOs. The government did not provide financial or in-kind support to NGOs that continued to provide the majority of protective services to trafficking victims. MASEF managed seven public day centers for the protection and social integration of children, which child trafficking victims could access. In addition, it expanded two of its day centers in Nouakchott to overnight shelters that could provide overnight and long-term care for child victims of crime. The Ministry of Interior's Special Brigade for Minors referred 305 vulnerable children to MASEF's day centers, including an unknown number of talibes exploited in forced begging, and 170 disabled children to MASEF's training center for handicapped children, compared with 540 children assisted in these centers in the previous reporting period. MASEF's day centers closed at night, so the talibes and other vulnerable children had to return to their exploitative situations or sleep on the streets. After short-term care, MASEF generally referred victims to other government shelters or NGOs for long-term care and vocational training; MASEF continued to assist 700 vulnerable children identified in previous years. The government allocated 35.5 million MRO ($100,000) to MASEF's day centers to fund staff and psycho-social assistance, a slight increase from 35 million MRO ($95,600) the previous reporting period. The government also allocated 3.66 million MRO ($10,300) to MASEF's Office of Childhood and 105 million MRO ($296,000) to MASEF's Vocational Training Center. Shelters accommodated both Mauritanian and foreign victims, although no shelters could accommodate adults; victims had to depart MASEF centers at age 18. The lack of long-term rehabilitative care rendered victims vulnerable to re-trafficking. The government did not provide any services to protect victims from threats or intimidation from their traffickers, nor did it provide training or services to help slavery victims adjust to life after slavery. The Ministry of Justice and MASEF conducted two capacity-building trainings for civil society organizations and government social workers to improve care for child victims of crime. 298MAURITANIADuring the reporting period, the African Union ruled in favor of two former Mauritanian slaves who argued that the government had failed to uphold the anti-trafficking law in their 2011 case. The court ruled the government should enroll the victims in school, provide identity documents, and provide psychological support; the government did not report providing these services after the ruling. The government did not have a formal policy to encourage victims to assist in investigations and prosecutions against their alleged traffickers. The 2015 anti-slavery law provided for comprehensive legal assistance for victims of hereditary slavery and the creation of support centers in each province; however, the government did not report implementing such provisions during the reporting period. While Tadamoun made efforts to reduce poverty, it did not make efforts to protect victims of slavery, which was a central component of its mandate. The law allowed victims to obtain restitution and file civil suits against their traffickers, although the complex and opaque legal system made such efforts extremely difficult; there were no reports any victims did so during the reporting period. The government did not provide legal alternatives to the removal of foreign victims to countries where they may face hardship or retribution. There were reports the government penalized and imprisoned on fornication charges girls who had been sexually abused, some of whom were likely victims of domestic servitude. Officials jailed women suspected of prostitution and held illegal migrants in detention until their refugee status had been resolved, without screening for trafficking. In 2017, the Ministry of Interior deported 4,971 foreign residents to their countries of origin without screening for trafficking. ","recommendation":"Hold government officials accountable for trafficking-related complicity, including the failure to investigate alleged slavery offenses and interference with ongoing investigations; significantly increase efforts to investigate, prosecute, and convict traffickers and slaveholders with sufficiently stringent sentences using the 2003 anti-trafficking and 2015 anti-slavery laws; sufficiently fund the anti-slavery courts, and train prosecutors and judicial officials on the 2003 anti-trafficking and 2015 anti-slavery laws; develop and train authorities on standard procedures to identify and refer trafficking and slavery victims to care; institute measures to support trafficking and slavery victims during investigations, including providing easier access to legal assistance and protection from intimidation and threats from their alleged traffickers; cease penalization of trafficking victims; investigate and prosecute individuals accused of fraudulently recruiting Mauritanians abroad for exploitation; legally recognize eligible anti-trafficking NGOs, allow them to operate freely within the country, and cease harassment of anti-slavery activists; with input from civil society, develop and implement a plan to provide economic resources\u0160through monetary or property allotment\u0160to former slaves and members of traditional slave castes to allow them the opportunity to leave their communities of enslavement; finalize and implement the anti-trafficking national action plan; and increase public awareness of trafficking, including hereditary slavery.","tier":"TIER 3","traffick_profile":"As reported over the past five years, Mauritania is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking. Adults and children from traditional slave castes in the Black Moor and Afro-Mauritanian communities are subjected to hereditary slavery practices rooted in ancestral master-slave relationships, where they are often forced to work without pay as cattle herders and domestic servants. Although reliable data on the total number of slaves does not exist, local and international experts agree hereditary slavery continues to affect a significant portion of the country's population in both rural and urban settings. Many former slaves and their descendants remain in a dependent status with their former slave owners, in part due to cultural tradition and a lack of marketable skills, poverty, and persistent drought. Some former slaves and descendants of slaves are forced or have no other viable option than to work for their old masters in exchange for some combination of lodging, food, and medical care. Some former slaves reportedly continue to work for their former masters or others under exploitative conditions to retain access to land that they had traditionally farmed. Some boys from Mauritania and other West African countries who study at Quranic schools are forced to beg for food and money to pay corrupt marabouts; boys from low-income families in the Halpulaar community are particularly vulnerable. Approximately 41 percent of Mauritanian children lack birth certificates and are thus generally not permitted to enroll in school, which increases their risk for trafficking. Fraudulent recruiters promise Mauritanian women and girls\u0160especially those from the traditional slave castes and Afro-Mauritanian communities\u0160shelter and an education but force them into domestic servitude, especially in larger cities such as Nouakchott, Nouadhibou, and Rosso. Children of Haratine and Afro-Mauritanian descent working in the fisheries sector are vulnerable to forced labor. An NGO reported girls in border towns have been forced to carry drugs. West African women and girls, especially Senegalese and Ivoirians, are vulnerable to domestic servitude and sex trafficking in Mauritania. Mauritanian, Nigerian, and Senegalese traffickers in the port city of Nouadhibou forced into prostitution Mauritanian women and West and Central African migrants transiting Mauritania en route to Europe. Refugees in Nouadhibou reportedly engage in prostitution due to their dire financial situations, increasing their vulnerability to forced prostitution. Sub-Saharan African migrants transit Mauritania en route to Morocco and Europe, where some are exploited in forced labor and sex trafficking. Mauritanian women and girls are fraudulently recruited by foreign agencies and Mauritanian middlemen for nursing and teaching jobs abroad and exploited in domestic servitude and sex trafficking in the Gulf, including Saudi Arabia. Men from Middle Eastern and North African countries use legally contracted temporary marriages to sexually exploit Mauritanian girls and young women. Mauritanian women and girls from poor families enter into these forced marriages, facilitated by brokers and travel agencies in both Mauritania and in the Middle East promising substantial payment, and are exploited as sex slaves and in forced prostitution in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries. In 2016, an international organization identified and removed from a refugee camp in southeastern 299MAURITIUSMauritania 16 Malian child soldiers aged 15-17 associated with Malian rebel groups; some of the victims had been recruited in Mali, and others allegedly had been recruited from the camp in Mauritania."},"Montenegro":{"April":0.0,"Asylum Seekers":"1","August":0.0,"December":0.0,"February":1.0,"Friday":0.0,"Global Population":627.81,"January":0.0,"July":1.0,"June":2.0,"Life Expectancy":76.77,"March":0.0,"May":1.0,"Monday":1.0,"November":0.0,"October":1.0,"Population below $1.90 a day":"1.7","Saturday":1.0,"September":0.0,"Sunday":0.0,"Thursday":0.0,"Tuesday":2.0,"Violence against civilians":6,"Wednesday":2.0,"fatalities":["0","0","0","0","0","0"],"government_effort":"NA","introduction":"The Government of Montenegro does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so.

The government produced semiannual progress reports on implementing the strategy and action plan and allocated \u2022176,630 ($212,040) to OFTIP, compared to \u2022174,862 ($209,920) in 2016. OFTIP led overall anti-trafficking efforts and the head of OFTIP was the national coordinator for the anti-trafficking task force, which comprised government agencies, non-governmental and international organizations, and the international community. OFTIP lost its status as an independent agency after reorganization into the MOI; observers reported the MOI did not fully recognize OFTIP's role and the reorganization created unnecessary administrative obstacles. The government organized seminars for health care workers, municipality representatives, social workers, and inspectors, on their respective roles and responsibilities in anti-trafficking efforts. The government continued to support two hotlines for victims of abuse and domestic violence, including trafficking victims. The hotline received 476 calls (414 in 2016), but none of the calls led to an investigation, and observers reported police rarely acted on potential cases from the hotline (15 potential trafficking cases initiated from calls in 2016). The government, in coordination with the Roma Council and NGOs, organized awareness campaigns targeting the Romani community on trafficking issues. The government also continued a national awareness campaign that included an awareness-raising video shown on television stations and increased cooperation with media outlets to advertise the hotline. Observers reported awareness campaigns lacked attention towards seasonal workers. Authorities provided specialized training to labor inspectors, although inspectors did not identify any cases of forced labor. The labor inspectorate reported its 32 inspectors was insufficient to fulfill its mandate. The government did not make efforts to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts or forced labor.","prosecution":"The government maintained law enforcement efforts. Article 444 of the criminal code criminalized all forms of trafficking and prescribed penalties ranging from one to ten years imprisonment, which were sufficiently stringent and, with respect to sex trafficking, commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. The government investigated two cases (seven in 2016) and prosecuted two defendants (no prosecutions in 2016 or 2015). The government did not secure any convictions under article 444 for the fourth consecutive year. Experts reported authorities investigated and prosecuted possible sex trafficking cases under other offenses, such as brokering in prostitution (article 210), due to a lack of evidence or reluctance of victims to act as a witness; one of the two cases investigated as trafficking led to a prosecution under brokering in prostitution. Experts reported prosecutors stopped some investigations when they secured enough evidence to prosecute under article 210 and did not investigate for more subtle forms of coercion or seek additional evidence through financial investigations or other specialized investigative techniques. In addition, experts were not aware of any cases referred to the prosecutor's office responsible for organized crime and noted weak coordination between police and prosecutors. Law enforcement maintained two task forces targeting forced child begging and sex trafficking, as well as a specialized trafficking unit within the police's organized crime department. Law enforcement conducted raids on bars, nightclubs, commercial sex sites, escort agencies, and businesses suspected of illegal employment practices, but these raids did not result in any trafficking investigations. The government did not report any investigations, prosecutions, or convictions of government employees complicit in human trafficking offenses. The Office for the Fight against Trafficking in Persons (OFTIP) and the Ministry of Interior (MOI), in cooperation with an international organization, trained 41 border police officers, 18 investigators, 16 prosecutors, and 17 judges. OFTIP, MOI, and the police academy trained 50 representatives from the police directorate on trafficking issues. The police academy also trained new police cadets on trafficking issues.","protection":"The government maintained victim protection efforts. The government identified one officially recognized victim and one potential sex trafficking victim (one potential forced begging victim in 2016). The government also identified three female children forced into marriage and vulnerable to domestic servitude (two children forced into marriage in 2016). The government-funded NGO-run shelter accommodated four victims (three in 2016). OFTIP allocated \u202223,500 ($28,210) to the NGO-run shelter, compared to \u202227,000 ($32,410) in 2016. Police identified 107 child beggars (75 in 2016 and 122 in 2015) but did not identify any as trafficking victims. The government accommodated most of the child beggars at local social welfare centers until releasing them to their parents or guardians.A multi-disciplinary national referral mechanism (NRM) provided standard operating procedures for identifying and referring victims to services. First responders carried out the preliminary identification of potential victims and then contacted police who formally recognized the individuals as potential trafficking victims. The government identified potential victims as an official trafficking victim only in cases with a final conviction or at times a formal indictment; however, the government provided the same services to potential victims and officially recognized victims. A multi-disciplinary coordination team led by the national coordinator monitored the implementation of the NRM and met twice a year and when 311MOROCCOa potential victim was identified. OFTIP provided training on victim identification to police, labor inspectors, health workers, social workers, and asylum officers; however, law enforcement still conducted the majority of proactive identification efforts. Police officers proactively screened foreign nationals and seasonal workers during the summer tourist season for indicators of trafficking. Observers reported the low number of identified victims reftected inadequate victim identification procedures. The government-funded NGO-run shelter provided specialized services for trafficking victims, including vocational training and medical, psycho-social, legal, and reintegration assistance. The shelter could accommodate adult male, adult female, and child victims in separate living quarters in the shelter. Victims could leave the shelter after assessment by police, or by the social welfare centers in the case of children. The Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare (MLSW) operated local and social welfare centers and two regional institutions, which provided general services for victims of abuse, including trafficking victims. Although MLSW did not provide specialized services for trafficking victims, MLSW could provide separate facilities for males and females. The law provided witness protection, free legal aid, and a psychologist to encourage victims to participate in prosecutions; however, observers reported the government assigned lawyers with little or no experience to victims in trafficking cases. The law also allowed for the possibility for victim restitution through civil suits and entitled foreign trafficking victims to receive a temporary residence permit, lasting from three months to one year, and work authorization. No victims applied for temporary residence permits in 2015, 2016, or 2017. One child victim participated in the prosecution of her trafficker; prosecutors video recorded her testimony in the presence of a social worker. The law on compensation of victims intended to provide financial assistance to victims of violent crimes; however, this law will not go into effect until Montenegro becomes a member of the EU. No victim has ever received restitution in civil or criminal proceedings; observers reported some prosecutors did not know they could make claims during criminal proceedings. The government did not penalize trafficking victims for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being subjected to human trafficking. ","recommendation":"Vigorously investigate, prosecute, and convict traffickers, including complicit officials, for trafficking crimes under article 444 of the criminal code; increase proactive screening of potential victims, especially for children engaged in begging, women in prostitution, and seasonal workers; provide advanced training to judges, prosecutors, and law enforcement on trafficking investigations and prosecutions; increase training of first responders on victim identification and referral; incentivize and encourage victim participation in investigations and prosecutions in a victim-centered manner; allocate sufficient resources to the labor inspectorate to increase proactive identification of forced labor victims; integrate Romani groups into decision-making processes regarding victim protection; create and finance an accessible compensation fund and inform victims of their right to compensation during legal proceedings; and ensure the Office for the Fight against Trafficking in Persons has adequate authority, capacity, and impact to implement anti-trafficking efforts.","tier":"TIER 2 WATCH LIST","traffick_profile":"As reported over the past five years, Montenegro is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to sex trafficking and forced labor. Victims of sex trafficking identified in Montenegro are primarily women and girls from Montenegro, neighboring Balkan countries, and, to a lesser extent, other countries in Eastern Europe. Sex trafficking victims are exploited in hospitality facilities, bars, restaurants, nightclubs, and cafes. Children, particularly Romani and Albanian children, are subjected to forced begging. Romani girls from Montenegro reportedly have been sold into marriages in Romani communities in Montenegro and, to a lesser extent, in Kosovo, and forced into domestic servitude.

It also established an inter-ministerial anti-trafficking committee to coordinate anti-trafficking policies and programs across ministries and created a specialized unit to combat trafficking among Moroccans overseas and migrants in the country. However, the government did not meet the minimum standards in several key areas. The government did not provide or fund specialized protection services specifically for trafficking victims, and did not report screening for trafficking victims, especially among irregular migrants who remained highly vulnerable to trafficking in Morocco. As a result, unidentified victims among vulnerable populations remained at risk of penalization and re-trafficking.

On Oct 09, the Moroccan navy opened fire at a boat carrying illegal Moroccan migrants in the Mediterranean sea, off the coast of Larache, leaving one of the passengers injured. On 25 September, the Moroccan navy opened fire at a speedboat carrying 20 illegal Moroccan migrants in the Mediterranean sea, off the coast of M'diq-Fnideq, leaving a Moroccan woman killed and three others wounded, including one seriously. In August, Moroccan police reportedly rounded up African migrants in Boukhalef and Mesnanatan, injuring numerous people, before they were deported to the South with buses. During one such transfers two Malians died. Fatalities split up into two events. On 2 July, a policeman attacked and injured a woman in the markets of Oujda after she reportedly resisted to move her street vending stand.

On the week of 22 May, a police officer slapped and verbally insulted a scooter driver who begged the officer not to seize his scooter. He was slightly injured. On initiative of the MoI, the police officer later had to apologize to him. On 18 April, a journalist from Akhbar al-Youm, Fatima Zohra Rajmi, was hit and injured by a lawyer in the court of appeal in Casablanca while covering the trial of Taoufik Bouachrine, the director of Akhbar al Youm. Around 29 March, inhabitants from the Tindouf refugee camp who were searching for gold in Mijik, the Moroccan Sahara, near the Mauritanian town of Zouerate were hunted, abused and robbed by the Polisario Front. They say that they have been tortured and beaten. Around 16 March, police forces arrested several dozens of protesters from Jerada and reportedly beat up several of them during the arrests. On 10 March Moroccan authorities have arrested two leaders, Amine Mkallech and Mustapaha Dainane, of the protest movement that began last December in Jerada. Dainine and Mqallech reported that police forces kicked them on their heads, backs, and necks while arresting them. The arrests led to a new wave of protests in Morocco.","prevention":"The government increased efforts to prevent human trafficking. In November 2017, the government finalized a decree to establish a national inter-ministerial anti-trafficking commission as required by the 2016 anti-trafficking law, which remained pending approval by the Councils of Government and Ministers at the end of the reporting period. The National Center for Listening and Reporting received 830 complaints on the exploitation and abuse of children, which may include trafficking crimes. MDMRAMA organized awareness campaigns on the anti-trafficking law for populations vulnerable to trafficking, such as women, children, and migrants, and provided assistance and employment-related trainings to 635 children at risk of human trafficking at professional and vocational training centers. The government implemented new laws during the reporting period prohibiting the employment of domestic workers under the age of 16 and strictly limited the employment of children between the ages of 16 and 18. The government allocated a budget of approximately $213,860 to the Ministry of Labor and Vocational Integration (MOLVI) to provide support to associations specifically working to combat child labor. Although MOLVI targets sectors and companies more likely to be violating the labor code and exploiting vulnerable persons such as children, the size of the country, scarcity of inspectors, and lack of financial resources limited its ability to monitor and adequately enforce the labor code. There was no national focal point to submit complaints about child labor and no national reciprocal referral mechanism for referring children found during inspections to appropriate social services. While the government provided some financial support to civil society actors who have made progress in child labor issues, service providers were often dependent on expertise and financing from international organizations and foreign donors. Observers have noted that while the government made efforts to protect vulnerable children, many government programs suffered from a lack of qualified personnel and adequate coordination. The government continued its regularization campaigns to grant legal status and protections including social services, education, and vocational training to migrants and refugees. The government did not make efforts to identify potential trafficking victims among those whose stay was regularized through this program. The government made minimal efforts to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts, child sex tourism, and forced labor and reported arresting foreign pedophiles among its efforts. The government provided its diplomatic personnel with human rights training, including respect for labor and trafficking in persons laws, in their basic courses before being assigned abroad. Moroccan peacekeeping forces received anti-trafficking training and operated under a \ufb01no tolerance\ufb02 standard for its troops involved in UN peacekeeping missions. ","prosecution":"The government increased its law enforcement efforts. Law 27.14 criminalized sex and labor trafficking and prescribed penalties of five to 10 years imprisonment and fines of up to $53,465, which were sufficiently stringent, and with regard to sex trafficking, commensurate with penalties for other serious crimes, such as rape. The law criminalized child trafficking as an aggravated offense, with prescribed penalties of 20 to 30 years' imprisonment and a fine of between $21,386 and $213,857. Several pre-existing laws used during the reporting period criminalized some forms of sex and labor trafficking. Generally, penalties under these laws were not sufficiently stringent. Morocco's penal code criminalized forced child labor through article 467-2, which prescribed penalties of one to three years imprisonment, which were not sufficiently stringent. The penal code also criminalized \ufb01forced prostitution\ufb02 and \ufb01child prostitution\ufb02 through articles 497-499, which prescribed penalties of up to 10 years; these penalties were sufficiently stringent and commensurate with other serious crimes such as rape. Article 10 of Morocco's labor code criminalized forced labor and prescribed penalties of a fine for the first offense and a jail term of up to three months for subsequent offenses; these penalties were not sufficiently stringent. The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) reported that proposed amendments to the penal code would expand the definition of the exploitation of children, including defining anyone under 18 (compared with prior age limit of 15) a child, and increased fines and prison sentences for those who exploit children in any way, including as labor; those amendments remained pending at the end of the reporting period. The media reported that the government investigated a total of 34 potential trafficking cases for calendar year 2017, as compared to 11 in 2016. The government reported prosecution of nine cases involving 20 alleged traffickers and four convictions, compared with four prosecutions and three convictions in 2016. This was the first reporting period for which the government recorded data specifically on trafficking-related arrests and convictions under this law. Among its investigations were eight sub-Saharan migrants for links to trafficking networks, more than 25 beauty salons and massage parlors in Casablanca for suspected trafficking-related crimes, and a journalist on human trafficking and sexual assault charges. The government reported that a U.S. citizen charged in the previous reporting period in a child sex trafficking case will be extradited to the United States for trial. The government reported that two Moroccan peacekeepers accused in 2016 of sexual exploitation were convicted under article 475 and 486 of the penal code for sexual abuse and sentenced to a year of prison and that the case of a third Moroccan peacekeeper accused in 2016 of sexual exploitation was pending. The government did not report the status of the cases of three Saudi Arabian nationals arrested in the same case of child sex trafficking. The government did not report the status of the perpetrators involved in 112 trafficking and migrant smuggling networks dismantled in 2017 or the 29 masterminds, 66 smugglers, and 12 accomplices reported to be involved in 33 trafficking-related criminal networks disbanded in 2016. External sources reported that the government continued to cooperate with Spain to extradite and prosecute international human traffickers, but it was not clear if any traffickers had been extradited by the Moroccan government. The MOJ organized regular training programs on human trafficking for judges and other judicial officials. The government reported training 80 labor inspectors and an unspecified number of security forces on how to identify and protect trafficking victims during the reporting period in addition to training 50 security forces from Guinea on combating trafficking of persons.The Minister Delegate to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation in Charge of Residents Abroad and Migration Affairs (MDMRAMA) led the implementation of the government's National Strategy for Immigration and Asylum, which included a project to combat trafficking in persons networks through the establishment of a specialized unit to combat trafficking during the reporting period. Through this project, MDMRAMA organized training sessions on the provisions of the anti-trafficking law and immigration, asylum, and trafficking for 185 government officials and security services personnel. The government did not report initiating any investigations, prosecutions, or convictions of government officials complicit in human trafficking; however, a Bulgarian NGO alleged that a Moroccan diplomat exploited a third-country national in domestic work while posted abroad. ","protection":" The government maintained minimal efforts to identify and protect trafficking victims. As in past years, the government remained without a formal process and did not report proactive efforts to identify trafficking victims, including within vulnerable populations such as irregular migrants. The government reported that 16 victims were referred to the MOJ's children and women protection units, and were subsequently provided medical care as needed and referred to NGOs for appropriate specialized assistance. It reported that 10 of the 16 were victims of sex trafficking, one of forced labor, four of forced begging, and one unknown. The government did not report efforts to refer or protect trafficking victims. The government covered all costs including psychological and medical support, reintegration, and repatriation assistance, including transportation, food, and hospital care as needed, to 426 Moroccans repatriated from Libya, a population vulnerable to trafficking. In partnership with international organizations, the Ministry of Health (MOH) began implementation of a strategic plan to institutionalize care for victims of violence, including foreign migrant women and children, who are vulnerable to trafficking, at reception centers staffed by nurses and social workers at major hospitals, and childrenwomen protection units in Moroccan courts. These hospital-based units provided integrated medical and psychological treatment and social support for an estimated 4,110 child victims of physical violence and 1,130 child victims of sexual violence in coordination with public partners and civil society in 2016, 313MOROCCOthe most recent period for which data was available; however, the government did not report how many of these children were victims of trafficking. The government also increased the number of child protection centers that offer emergency response and reported that 4,300 children participated in child protection center programs.While the government remained without a formal victim referral process, both the Ministry of Solidarity, Women, Family, and Social Development and MOH coordinated with civil society to provide assistance to trafficking victims. Some local law enforcement officials had an ad hoc referral process\u0160utilizing identified contacts at reception centers and a list of NGO service providers that they shared with local and regional authorities as a resource. The government began an inter-ministerial working group to improve assistance for and protection of trafficking victims, but remained without protection services designed or funded specifically to assist trafficking victims. Civil society organizations continued to be the primary providers of protection services for trafficking victims. The government reportedly continued to encourage victims to cooperate in investigations against their traffickers, but did not report on the number of victims who provided testimony during the reporting period, whether victims received restitution from traffickers, or how witness confidentiality would be protected. Although the government drastically decreased deportations of migrants over the last couple of years, it continued to conduct forced internal relocations of irregular migrants. As the government remained without a formal victim identification process and made minimal efforts to identify potential trafficking victims among the vulnerable irregular migrant population, victims likely remained unidentified in the law enforcement system and may have been penalized for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being subjected to trafficking, such as immigration and prostitution violations. The government provided legal alternatives to the removal of foreign victims of trafficking to countries where they might face retribution or hardship.","recommendation":"Implement the 2017 decree for the National Commission to 312MOROCCOcoordinate anti-trafficking measures and directly train judicial and law enforcement authorities on its application; significantly increase trafficking-related investigations, prosecutions, and convictions of traffickers and impose sufficiently stringent sentences; continue to develop and implement procedures for officials to proactively identify and refer trafficking victims, especially among irregular migrants; ensure that victims are not punished for crimes committed as a direct result of being subjected to human trafficking, such as immigration and prostitution violations; provide adequate protection services for trafficking victims and witnesses via funding or in-kind support to NGOs that provide specialized services for victims of all forms of trafficking; develop and systemically implement formal procedures for victim identification and referral to care using a victim-centered approach; address obstacles to integration faced by migrants who face abuse in the security system and elsewhere; and disaggregate the data between human trafficking and migrant smuggling crimes.","tier":"TIER 2","traffick_profile":"As reported over the past five years, Morocco is a source, destination, and transit country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking. According to a November 2015 study conducted by the Moroccan government, with support by an international organization, children are exploited in Morocco for labor, domestic work, begging, and sex trafficking. Although the incidence of child domestic workers has reportedly decreased since 2005, girls are recruited from rural areas for work in domestic service in cities and become victims of forced labor. Some Moroccan boys endure forced labor while employed as apprentices in the artisanal and construction industries and in mechanic shops. The 2015 study also found that some Moroccan women are forced into prostitution in Morocco by members of their families or other intermediaries. Some female undocumented migrants, primarily from Sub-Saharan Africa and a small but growing number from South Asia, are coerced into prostitution and forced labor. Criminal networks operating in Oujda on the Algerian border and in the northern coastal town of Nador force undocumented migrant women into prostitution and begging; networks in Oujda also reportedly force children of migrants to beg. Some female migrants, particularly Nigerians, who transit Oujda are forced into prostitution once they reach Europe. International organizations, local NGOs, and migrants report unaccompanied children and women from Cote d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Nigeria, and Cameroon are highly vulnerable to sex trafficking and forced labor in Morocco. Some reports suggest Cameroonian and Nigerian networks force women into prostitution, while Nigerian networks also force women to beg in the streets by threatening the victims and their families; the victims are typically the same nationality as the traffickers. Some women from the Philippines and Indonesia are recruited for employment as domestic workers in Morocco; upon arrival, some are subjected to forced labor, experiencing non-payment 314MOZAMBIQUEof wages, withholding of passports, and physical abuse at the hands of their employers.Moroccan men, women, and children are exploited in forced labor and sex trafficking, primarily in Europe and the Middle East.

The NRG met at least three times during the reporting period to coordinate anti-trafficking efforts at the national level. The NRG revised and approved updated terms of reference for the group and finalized and approved its 2017 work plan, which outlined training for labor inspectors and consular officers. A sub-group of 15 NRG members finalized the development of supporting documents to the NRM, which were adopted by the NRG. The NRG drafted standard operating procedures for the NRG and implementation of the NRM; however, these were not finalized or adopted during the reporting period. In October 2017, in partnership with an international organization, the government held public consultations on the draft national action plan in two provinces that were attended by the Deputy Prosecutor General, members of the national and provincial reference groups, local government officials, civil society and journalists; however, the national action plan was not passed during the reporting period. Provincial-level reference groups, consisting of local officials, police, border guards, social workers, NGOs, and faith-based organizations, carried out awareness campaigns to educate the public in urban and rural areas and coordinated regional efforts to address trafficking and other crimes. In August 2017, in partnership with an international organization, the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic (PGR) trained 26 members of the Niassa Reference Group on the international and national legal framework on trafficking. The government continued to participate in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) regional data collection tool by uploading trafficking cases, victim and trafficker profiles, and sharing information with countries in the region. Through its participation in the data tool, UNODC and SADC launched the first annual draft analysis report for the region. In partnership with international organizations, for the first time the government trained 25 labor inspectors on trafficking victim identification and referral. Members of the NRG participated in TV and radio debates on World Day Against Human Trafficking. In September 2017, the PGR and the Ministry of Labor coordinated with an international organization to train 25 labor inspectors for the first time ever on the international legal framework on trafficking, trafficking indicators for labor exploitation, and the referral process to ensure victims receive protective services. In coordination with an international organization, the government liaised with two airlines identified as transporting labor migrants traveling on falsified visas to prevent further travel. Mozambican officials remained without effective policies or laws regulating foreign recruiters and holding them civilly and criminally liable for fraudulent recruiting. The government did not demonstrate tangible efforts to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts or forced labor during the year. ","prosecution":"The government decreased its anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts. The Law on Preventing and Combating the Trafficking of People, enacted in 2008, criminalized sex and labor trafficking and prescribed penalties of 16 to 20 years imprisonment. These penalties were sufficiently stringent and, with respect to sex trafficking, commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. In 2017, the government investigated five trafficking cases, all of which were forced labor, compared with 20 the previous year. The government prosecuted six defendants in all five cases compared with 17 defendants the previous year. The government convicted six labor traffickers under the 2008 anti-trafficking law, all of whom received prison terms, ranging from two to 16 years imprisonment, compared with 16 convictions in 2016. For the first time, the government disaggregated trafficking case data from other related crimes, thus providing a more accurate understanding of law enforcement efforts. The government did not report any investigations, prosecutions, or convictions of government officials complicit in human trafficking offenses.The government expanded training for law enforcement on victim identification and trained 100 immigration officials in the protection of vulnerable migrants with a specific focus on trafficking. The government provided in-kind support and paid travel costs of participants to the majority of trainings led by international organizations during the reporting period. The Attorney General's Office signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Republic of South Africa addressing cross-border cooperation on trafficking cases and drafted MOUs with Eswatini and Zambia. In December 2017, in partnership with an international organization, the Attorney General's Office trained 24 officials, including prosecutors, police officers, immigration officials, and social workers in a two-day workshop in Tete province. The officials were trained on victim identification, data collection, and data ftow through the government's system. As a result of the training, the Tete-based officials determined four cases they had submitted to the Attorney General's Office were actually smuggling cases and removed them from the system. Expert reports alleged traffickers commonly bribed police and immigration officials to facilitate trafficking crimes both domestically and across international borders. ","protection":"The government increased protection efforts. The government identified and referred to care 53 victims, including 35 forced labor victims, three sex trafficking victims; 15 were victims of both forced labor and sex trafficking compared with 11 trafficking victims identified and referred during the previous reporting period. In partnership with an international organization, the Ministry of Gender, Children, and Social Action (MGCAS) operated three dedicated trafficking shelters, which provided medical, psychological, legal assistance to all adult and child victims. The MGCAS provided family reunification and reintegration for at least 12 child victims. In partnership with an international organization, the government developed a draft national referral mechanism (NRM) during the reporting period, which remained awaiting finalization and implementation. However, implementing regulations for trafficking victim and witness protection were not drafted or finalized by the end of the reporting period.Police stations throughout the country had specialists trained by the Office of Assistance to Women and Children Victims of Domestic Violence who were equipped and available to respond 315NAMIBIAto suspected trafficking cases. The government continued to operate facilities in more than 215 police stations and 22 \ufb01Victims of Violence\ufb02 centers throughout the country offering temporary shelter, food, limited counseling, and monitoring following reintegration for victims of crime; however, it remained unclear whether trafficking victims benefited from these services in 2017. The Attorney General's Office convened relevant government stakeholders to assess and coordinate their joint efforts to address victims' needs in several specific cases during the reporting period. The technical working group on victim protection, a sub-group of the NRG consisting of prosecutors at the provincial level, child and social services and department of health personnel, police officers and two international NGOs, held a conference to discuss current trafficking cases, an outcome of which was improved coordination between the NRG and provincial and district-level front-line responders to ensure better oversight and monitoring of trafficking cases. The anti-trafficking law required police protection for victims who participated as witnesses in criminal proceedings against traffickers, and the government provided such assistance to one victim during the reporting period. In at least one case, the NRG proactively sought translation services for a non-Portuguese speaking victim. Although Mozambican law provided for temporary residency status or legal alternatives to the removal of foreign victims to countries where they might face hardship or retribution, the government did not use this provision during the reporting period.","recommendation":"Increase efforts to prosecute and convict traffickers; finalize and implement the national action plan, and issue regulations necessary to implement the protection and prevention provisions of the 2008 anti-trafficking law; expand the availability of protective services for victims via increased funding or in-kind support to relevant partners in the National Group to Protect Children and Combat Trafficking in Persons; build the capacity of the labor inspectorate and the Women and Children's Victim Assistance Units to investigate trafficking cases and provide short-term protection to victims; develop a formal system to proactively identify trafficking victims among vulnerable populations and finalize and implement the national referral mechanism; and train officials to investigate and prosecute those facilitating child sex trafficking or adult forced prostitution.","tier":"TIER 2","traffick_profile":"As reported over the past five years, Mozambique is a source, transit, and, to a lesser extent, destination country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking. The use of forced child labor occurs in agriculture, mining, and market vending in rural areas, often with the complicity of family members. In addition to voluntary migrants from neighboring countries, women and girls from rural areas, lured to cities in Mozambique or South Africa with promises of employment or education, are exploited in domestic servitude and sex trafficking. Mozambican girls are exploited in bars, roadside clubs, overnight stopping points, and restaurants along the southern transport corridor that links Maputo with Eswatini and South Africa. Child sex trafficking is of growing concern in Maputo, Beira, Chimoio, Tete, and Nacala, which have highly mobile populations and large numbers of truck drivers. As workers and economic migrants seek employment in the growing extractive industries in Tete and Cabo Delgado, they increase the demand for sexual services, potentially including child sex trafficking. Mozambican men and boys are subjected to forced labor on South African farms and mines where they often labor for months without pay under coercive conditions before being turned over to police for deportation as illegal migrants. Mozambican boys migrate to Eswatini to wash cars, herd livestock, and sell goods; some subsequently become victims of forced labor. Mozambican adults and girls are subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking in Angola, Italy, and Portugal. Persons with albinism, including children, are increasingly vulnerable to trafficking for the purpose of organ removal. Informal networks typically comprise Mozambican or South African traffickers. South Asian smugglers who move undocumented South Asian migrants throughout Africa also reportedly transport trafficking victims through Mozambique. Previous reports allege traffickers bribe officials to move victims within the country and across national borders to South Africa and Eswatini.

The government demonstrated increasing efforts compared to the previous reporting period; therefore Nepal remained on Tier 2. The government demonstrated increasing efforts through increased trafficking investigations, prosecutions, and convictions. Law enforcement investigated and arrested several allegedly complicit officials. With direct government support, NGOs opened two rehabilitation homes, 19 emergency shelters, and 19 community service centers for female victims of gender-based violence, including trafficking. The government established 312 Local Committees for Controlling Human Trafficking (LCCHTs) and issued a directive to recruitment agencies to furnish information demonstrating their adherence to the low-cost migration policy. However, the government did not meet the minimum standards in several key areas. Its laws do not prohibit all forms of forced labor and sex trafficking and it continued to lack standard operating procedures (SOPs) on victim identification and referral to rehabilitation services. Despite a large number of male migrant workers who experience abuse overseas, government protection efforts disproportionately focused on female victims, and the government did not report providing any services to male victims during the reporting period. Official complicity in trafficking offenses remained a serious problem due to both direct complicity in trafficking crimes as well as negligence. Many government officials continued to lack understanding of trafficking. Officials encouraged migrant workers who experienced exploitation abroad to register cases under the Foreign Employment Act (FEA), which criminalized fraudulent recruitment, rather than notify police of labor exploitation, and prosecutors frequently declined to charge a case under the trafficking law if it had already been charged under the FEA, despite the difference in crimes. The government maintained its policies preventing female migration in several ways, and observers continued to report the revised policies led women to use illegal methods to migrate, which subsequently increased their vulnerability to human trafficking.","iso3":"NPL","latitude":["27.7017","27.7017","27.5445","26.6097","28.6289","26.5027","28.25","27.6787","28.4188","27.3778","28.4188","27.7017","28.2361","27.6781","27.3103","27.6768","28.63"],"location":["Kathmandu","Kathmandu","Kapilvastu","Ranigaun","Musikot","Harinagar","Sulichaur","Kirtipur","Rajapur","Manthali","Rajapur","Kathmandu","Chhamarke","Dolakha","Okhaldhunga","Bharatpur","Ghodaghodi"],"longitude":["85.3206","85.3206","83.0536","87.2734","82.4793","87.1275","82.7311","85.2775","81.1299","86.069","81.1299","85.3206","83.6649","86.0779","86.505","84.4359","80.961"],"notes":"On December 13, police assaulted and arrested a female photojournalist from the President's office in Kathmandu city (Kathmandu district, Bagmati), while she was capturing photos for the news.

The government continued to establish LCCHTs and funded them through the DCCHTs. As of January 2018, 732 LCCHTs were in operation, an increase of 312 from the previous reporting period. MWCSW allocated approximately 110,240 NPR ($1,080) to each of the 75 DCCHTs to support awareness campaigns, meeting expenses, and emergency victim services. This was a slight increase from the 98,900 NPR ($970) allocated last fiscal year. While the NCCHT continued to meet with and train officials from the DCCHTs, observers continued to note the need for improved coordination between the NCCHT, DCCHTs, and LCCHTs. In January 2018, MWCSW reviewed the government's implementation of the 2012-2022 national action plan and found the government had completed 68 percent of prevention and 52 percent of protection activities, but only 31 percent of prosecution and 21 percent of capacity building, cooperation, and coordination activities. The review also highlighted the need to revise the national action plan to align anti-trafficking programming with the constitutional transition to federalism, as well as to better address forced labor. MWCSW issued its fifth report on the government's anti-trafficking efforts, and the National Human Rights Commission's Office of the Special Rapporteur on Trafficking in Women and Children issued its eighth report on human trafficking. The government conducted public awareness campaigns throughout the country, sometimes in partnership with NGOs or international organizations. In nine districts, special committees continued to monitor the adult entertainment sector for abuses. Observers stated their effectiveness was limited, however, due to a lack of funding and legislation to establish the committees' formal role. The government's 2015 labor migration guidelines include a policy requiring foreign employers to pay for visa and transportation costs for Nepali migrant workers bound for Malaysia and the Gulf states and restrict agency-charged recruitment fees to 10,000 NPR ($98). In April 2017, DFE issued a directive to recruitment agencies to furnish financial details demonstrating their adherence to the policy; by September 2017, 750 of 1,097 agencies had fulfilled the requirement and DFE fined 30 agencies between 50,000-100,000 NPR ($488-$977) for failing to provide details of or clarification on their adherence. Both NGOs and officials noted enforcement of the low-cost migration policy was difficult and reported employment agencies regularly charged migrant workers for visa and transportation costs and fees above the 10,000 NPR ($98) limit. In October 2017, the government signed a bilateral labor agreement with Jordan stipulating employment conditions and the employer's responsibility to pay for migrant worker expenses such as airfare, insurance, health screenings, and visas. The government maintained its ban on migration of female domestic workers under age 24 to Gulf states and of mothers with children under age two. At the government's invitation, the UN Special Rapporteur on the Human Rights of Migrants visited Nepal in January 2018. The UN, other international organizations, and local NGOs continued to argue any ban on female migration increased the likelihood such women would migrate illegally and therefore heightened their vulnerability 320NETHERLANDSto human trafficking. The government did not make efforts to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts or forced labor. The government provided anti-trafficking training for all Nepali peacekeeping forces before deployment. Nepal is not a party to the 2000 UN TIP Protocol; however, during the reporting period, MWCSW finalized its study on the costs of acceding to the protocol and the home ministry forwarded to the Cabinet a recommendation to accede to the protocol.","prosecution":"The government increased anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts. The 2007 HTTCA criminalized some forms of labor and sex trafficking. The HTTCA criminalized slavery and bonded labor but did not criminalize the recruitment, transportation, harboring, or receipt of persons by force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of forced labor. It criminalized forced prostitution but, inconsistent with international law, required a demonstration of force, fraud, or coercion to constitute a child sex trafficking offense, and therefore did not criminalize all forms of child sex trafficking. Prescribed penalties ranged from 10 to 20 years imprisonment, which were sufficiently stringent and, with respect to sex trafficking, commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. The 2002 Bonded Labor (Prohibition) Act criminalized bonded labor and the Child Labor Act criminalized forced child labor. The FEA criminalized fraudulent and deceptive labor recruitment. For the third consecutive year, the National Committee for Controlling Human Trafficking (NCCHT) drafted revisions to the HTTCA to bring the definition of human trafficking in line with international law; the HTTCA had not been amended by the end of the reporting period.The Nepal Police Women's Cells (NPWCs) conducted 227 investigations under the HTTCA during the Nepali fiscal year, compared with 212 cases in the previous fiscal year. The 227 cases involved 389 alleged traffickers of whom 259 were arrested and 130 remained at large. NPWCs investigated crimes in which women and girls were the primary victims; other police investigative units handled crimes involving male victims. The Central Investigative Bureau (CIB) investigated eight transnational cases between April and December 2017, compared with 20 transnational cases and six internal cases during the same time period in 2016. The government initiated prosecutions in 303 cases during the fiscal year, an increase compared with 218 cases in the previous year, and continued to prosecute 184 cases from the previous reporting period. This data was not disaggregated to distinguish between sex and labor trafficking cases. At the district level, courts convicted 274 traffickers during the fiscal year, compared with 262 traffickers in the previous year, and acquitted 233 accused. Legal experts stated that prosecutors could pursue a case under both the HTTCA and the FEA for transnational labor trafficking and foreign employment fraud, respectively; however, prosecutors regularly refused to do so believing such action would violate the prohibition against double jeopardy. Department of Foreign Employment (DFE) officials continued to advise abused migrant workers returning to Nepal to register complaints under the FEA rather than notify police. Victims of transnational labor trafficking preferred to submit claims for restitution through the FEA rather than pursue lengthy criminal prosecutions under the HTTCA, often to avoid the stigma associated with being labeled a trafficking victim (assumed to insinuate sex trafficking) and because the potential to be awarded restitution was higher. The government had standard training for labor, immigration, judicial, law enforcement, and foreign employment officials that incorporated anti-trafficking training. During the reporting period, the police and judicial academies hosted two separate trainings, with the support of a foreign government, on combating trafficking for police, prosecutors, NGO representatives, and DFE officials. Despite these trainings, police lacked sophisticated investigative techniques and skills to interact in a victim-centered way with trafficking survivors; these deficiencies subsequently undermined prosecution efforts. Official complicity in trafficking offenses remained a serious problem. NGOs alleged some police and political party leaders were complicit in domestic sex trafficking because of their financial involvement in the adult entertainment sector. Observers alleged some traffickers enjoyed impunity due to personal connections with politicians or by bribing police. Some government officials were reportedly bribed to include false information in genuine Nepali passports or to provide fraudulent documents to prospective labor migrants or foreign employment agents. In August 2017, a parliamentary committee stated due to the negligence or complicity of immigration officials and police, girls and women were able to depart from the international airport without completing the required migrant work exit procedures; the committee stated up to 60 percent of Nepali domestic workers in the Gulf states were working illegally without the proper visa and safeguards. In November 2017, the commission arrested the Director General of DFE and two DFE officials for allegedly attempting to collect a bribe from a foreign employment agency; the three officials were released on bail or their own recognizance and were awaiting trial at the end of the reporting period. In December 2017, police arrested a recently-elected local official for allegedly exploiting two Nepali girls in sex trafficking in India; while the official was released on bail and awaiting trial for this offense, CIB arrested him for a prior trafficking crime for which he had been convicted in absentia and initiated his six-year term of imprisonment. ","protection":"The government maintained overall efforts to protect female trafficking victims; however, protection efforts for male victims remained wholly inadequate. The government did not have SOPs for victim identification and referral to rehabilitation services, although police did have internal guidelines on the identification and treatment of victims. Authorities did not systematically track the total number of victims identified, but did identify 368 victims connected to the 235 investigations initiated during the Nepali fiscal year, compared with 419 victims identified the previous year. Of the 311 NPWCs identified victims, 67 were subjected to sex trafficking, 125 to forced labor, and 119 victims' cases were uncategorized. It was unknown how many of these victims were exploited abroad, although 57 victims identified by CIB were victims of transnational trafficking, primarily in Gulf states. Of the total victims identified, 89 were under age 18 and almost all were female\u0160only four were male. Officials' poor understanding of the crime, a lack of formal SOPs for identification, and victims' reluctance to be identified due to stigma hindered proper and proactive identification, especially among returning male labor migrants who reported exploitation abroad. NGOs continued to report government efforts to identify domestic sex trafficking victims improved. Police increased the number of inspections of Kathmandu adult entertainment businesses and more consistently worked to screen for sex trafficking to avoid penalizing victims for prostitution crimes. When properly identified, victims were not detained, fined, or jailed for crimes committed as a result of being subjected to human trafficking. Although the government had national minimum standards for victim care and referral to services, referral efforts remained 319NEPALad hoc and inadequate. It is unclear how many victims were referred to and able to utilize services during the year. Ministry of Women, Children, and Social Welfare (MWCSW) reported its online directory, launched in the previous reporting period to catalog service providers for trafficking victims and migration-related exploitation, had not met its expectations for utilization but there were no efforts to improve it. The government decreased its contribution to provide services for female victims of violence, including trafficking, from 19 million Nepali rupees (NPR) ($186,000) during the 2016-2017 fiscal year to 10 million NPR ($97,700) for the 2017-2018 fiscal year, although this fund's financing was cumulative and had approximately 16 million NPR ($156,000) in the fund at the beginning of the year. During the reporting period and with support from MWCSW, NGOs opened two rehabilitation homes, 19 emergency shelters, and 19 community service centers for female victims of gender-based violence, including trafficking, bringing the total of government-supported homes to 10, emergency shelters to 36, and community service centers to 123. MWCSW also supported an NGO-run long-term shelter for female victims of violence, including trafficking. MWCSW provided the NGOs funding for three staff members per shelter, some facility expenses, and victim assistance, including legal assistance, psychological support, transportation, medical expenses, and skills training, although NGOs reported this funding was only distributed if NGOs requested reimbursement. Unlike in previous years, MWCSW did not allocate funds for the protection and rehabilitation of male trafficking victims; however, according to the MWCSW, male victims were entitled to the same support as female victims and the government could re-allocate funds for their rehabilitation if male victims sought services. An NGO ran one shelter for men in Kathmandu. Victims had the ability to seek restitution from a rehabilitation fund if the government was unable to collect fines from traffickers under the HTTCA. District courts in Kathmandu, Bhaktapur, and Chitwan ordered their respective district committees for controlling human trafficking (DCCHTs) to provide restitution from the fund, and MWCSW reported DCCHTs had initiated the process for some victims. Overall victim-witness protection mechanisms remained insufficient. Notably the victim's right to police protection was not upheld due to resource limitations and observers stated victims were reluctant to file criminal complaints under HTTCA in part because of personal or family safety concerns. Victim protection mechanisms were also impeded by a 2015 amendment to the HTTCA that reinstated a provision allowing victims to be fined if they failed to appear in court or to be held criminally liable for providing testimony contradicting their previous statements. The government did not have established procedures for alternatives to the deportation of foreign victims.While Nepali embassies in Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, and United Arab Emirates provided emergency shelters for vulnerable female workers, some of whom were trafficking victims, the Foreign Employment Promotion Board (FEPB) acknowledged the shelters lacked sufficient space and resources to meet the high demand for assistance. FEPB collected fees from departing registered migrant workers for a welfare fund to provide repatriation and one year of financial support to families of injured or deceased workers, which could include trafficking victims. During the fiscal year, the fund provided financial support to the families of 102 injured and 810 deceased migrant workers, and paid to repatriate 50 workers. FEBP may also repatriate unregistered migrant workers by requesting funds through the finance ministry on an ad hoc basis. It is unknown if unregistered workers were repatriated during the reporting period. In December 2017, DFE launched an online application for migrant workers facing abusive or untenable situations overseas, or someone on the migrant worker's behalf, to file a request with officials for repatriation. In the first two months of the application, DFE received 227 repatriation requests; it is unknown how many of these requests were fulfilled or stemmed from trafficking crimes. ","recommendation":" Amend the Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act (HTTCA) to bring the definition of human trafficking in line with the 2000 UN TIP Protocol; respecting due process, increase investigations, prosecutions, and convictions against all forms of trafficking, including bonded labor, transnational labor trafficking of Nepali males, sex trafficking of Nepali females within Nepal, and against officials complicit in trafficking-related crimes; institute formal procedures for proactive identification and referral of trafficking victims to protection services and train officials on the procedures; expand access to and availability of victim care, including to exploited workers overseas and male victims in general; penalize licensed labor recruiters who engage in fraudulent recruitment or charge excessive fees; implement victim witness protection provisions in the HTTCA; enforce the low-cost recruitment policy and continue to take steps to eliminate all recruitment fees charged to workers; ensure victims are not punished for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being subjected to trafficking and remove the HTTCA provision reinstated in 2015 that 318NEPALallows victims to be fined if they fail to appear in court or held criminally liable for providing testimony contradicting their previous statements; lift current bans on female migration to discourage migration through undocumented channels; and accede to the 2000 UN TIP Protocol.","tier":"TIER 2","traffick_profile":"As reported over the past five years, Nepal is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking. Nepali women and girls are subjected to sex trafficking in Nepal, India, the Middle East, Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa. Nepali men, women, and children are subjected to forced labor in Nepal, India, the Middle East, and Asia in construction, factories, mines, domestic work, begging, and the adult entertainment industry. Manpower agencies or individual employment brokers who engage in fraudulent recruitment practices and impose high fees may facilitate forced labor. Unregistered migrants\u0160including the large number of Nepalis who travel through India or rely on unregistered recruiting agents\u0160are particularly vulnerable to forced labor and sex trafficking. Some Nepali women who agree to arranged marriages through Nepali companies to men in China and South Korea may experience fraud and be vulnerable to domestic servitude in which their freedom of movement is restricted. Some migrants from Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and possibly other countries transit Nepal en route to employment in the Middle East, using potentially falsified Nepali travel documents, and may be subjected to human trafficking. Some government officials reportedly accept bribes to include false information in Nepali identity documents or provide fraudulent documents to prospective labor migrants, a tactic used by unscrupulous recruiters to evade recruitment regulations. Within Nepal, bonded labor exists in agriculture, brick kilns, the stone-breaking industry, and domestic work. Sex trafficking of Nepali women and girls increasingly takes place in private apartments, rented rooms, guest houses, and restaurants. Nepali and Indian children are subjected to forced labor in the country, especially in domestic work, brick kilns, and the embroidered textile, or zari, industry. Under false promises of education and work opportunities, Nepali parents give their children to brokers who instead take them to frequently unregistered children's homes in urban locations, where they are forced to pretend to be orphans to garner donations from tourists and volunteers; some of the children are also forced to beg on the street. Many Nepalis, including children, whose home or livelihood was destroyed by the 2015 earthquakes continue to be vulnerable to trafficking. Traffickers increasingly utilize social media and mobile technologies to lure and deceive their victims.

The government demonstrated significant efforts during the reporting period by reporting law enforcement and victim identification data for the first time in three years, increasing anti-trafficking training for law enforcement officials and judges, and expanding outreach and awareness programs that included civil society, religious leaders, journalists, and security forces. However, the government did not demonstrate increasing efforts compared to the previous reporting period. The government did not report investigating, prosecuting, or convicting any individuals for traditional slavery practices. Victim protection services remained inadequate and the government has not formalized its standard operating procedures to identify or refer trafficking victims to care. Because the government has devoted sufficient resources to a written plan that, if implemented, would constitute significant efforts to meet the minimum standards, Niger was granted a waiver per the Trafficking Victims Protection Act from an otherwise required downgrade to Tier 3. Therefore Niger remained on Tier 2 Watch List for the third consecutive year.

The National Coordinating Commission for the Fight against Trafficking in Persons continued to serve as the coordinating body for the government's anti-trafficking efforts, and the ANLTPTIM was the government's permanent implementing body to address trafficking in persons, although budget constraints impeded anti-trafficking efforts. The ANLTPTIM increased its public awareness campaigns and used multiple media platforms to familiarize the public with trafficking, and partnered with an Islamic cleric to address the common issue of marabouts using children for forced labor and begging, in addition to traditional slavery practices. The government increased public engagement around its annual September 28 anti-trafficking day events, which featured government officials on radio and television to raise awareness of the crime. The government may have shut down or charged labor recruiters or brokers who recruited workers with knowingly fraudulent offers of employment or job placement. The government took no discernible measures to address the demand for forced labor or commercial sex acts. The government was in the final year of its five-year national action plan to combat trafficking in persons, but implementation was an issue due to funding constraints. The ANLTPTIM expanded its national engagement with prosecutors' offices, improving its collection of trafficking statistics and law enforcement coordination across the country, and partnered with an international organization to study forced begging. The government did not take measures to establish the identity of local populations, although the majority of Nigeriens lacked valid identity documents, the lack of which increased individuals' vulnerability to trafficking. The government increased monitoring of its borders. Bylaws governing the armed forces required troops to receive anti-trafficking training prior to their deployment abroad on international peacekeeping missions and the government addressed such requirements through a program conducted by a foreign donor. The government did not report providing anti-trafficking training for its diplomatic personnel.","prosecution":"The government maintained prosecution efforts; it reported law enforcement statistics for the first time in three years. Order No.2012-86 on Combating Trafficking in Persons, enacted in 2010, criminalized sex and labor trafficking, including slavery, practices similar to slavery, and exploitative begging. This law prescribed sufficiently stringent punishments of five to 10 years imprisonment for committing trafficking offenses against adults and 10 to 30 years when the victim was a child. Penalties for child sex trafficking were commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape, but those prescribed for sex trafficking of adults were not. Article 270 of the penal code also criminalized slavery and prescribed penalties of 10 to 30 years imprisonment. The labor code, enacted in September 2012, criminalized forced labor, prescribing penalties of two to five years imprisonment or a fine. The government reported investigating 29 suspected traffickers, one prosecution, and no convictions during the reporting period, compared with zero reported investigations, prosecutions, or convictions during the previous two reporting periods. The government did not make progress in addressing impunity for marabouts, teachers at Quranic schools, who forced children to beg, or customary chiefs who facilitated traditional slavery practices, including the enslavement of children. There was a lack of access to justice for victims, as they were often uninformed about their legal rights and lacked the necessary capacities and resources to seek punitive action against their exploiters. There were no reported developments in pending slavery cases, some of which have reportedly been ongoing for years. A lack of judicial capacity and limited government budgets resulted in prosecutorial delays and unfulfilled victim protection requirements of the 2010 anti-trafficking law. In 2017, the government trained police, prosecutors, and judges on the national trafficking law and victim protection. The government coordinated with INTERPOL in a regional anti-trafficking operation. During this operation, the National Agency for the Fight against Trafficking in Persons and the Illicit Transport of Migrants (ANLTPTIM) reported that Nigerien law enforcement officials identified a fraudulent employment agency placing Nigerien women in Middle Eastern countries; the investigation of this agency remained ongoing at the end of the reporting period. ANLTPTIM provided training and written materials to law enforcement personnel on proactive identification of trafficking victims. Additionally, two trainings in February 2017 involved 40 judges and focused on differentiating between human trafficking and migrant smuggling cases. A workshop in November 2017 in Niamey brought together 20 judges for an information exchange focused on prosecuting traffickers under current legal frameworks. There were no investigations, prosecutions, or convictions of government officials for complicity in trafficking or trafficking-related criminal activities; however, corruption and official complicity in trafficking crimes remained concerns and may have impeded law enforcement action during the year. Extreme poverty across the country further exacerbated law enforcement challenges, as many border officials were reportedly not adequately resourced. The UN investigated Nigerien peacekeepers for sexual exploitation in two countries; investigators determined that Nigerien peacekeepers serving in an African nation sexually exploited two adults in 2015. The government did not provide an update on the outcomes of the two cases.","protection":" The government increased efforts to identify victims, but protection efforts remained inadequate. The government did not compile comprehensive victim identification and assistance statistics, although it did leverage partnerships with international organizations to overcome resource constraints and provide services to victims. The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) reported identifying 108 victims in the course of law enforcement operations, a change from the lack of victim identification data reported by the government during the previous two reporting periods. The government did not report whether it referred these victims to care. Authorities did not employ systematic measures to identify trafficking victims among vulnerable populations, such as women and girls born into traditional slave castes or children at worksites. ANLTPTIM developed a national referral mechanism, which remained pending ratification by the National Assembly at the close of the reporting period. The government did not provide any specialized services for adult victims or victims of hereditary slavery. The government partnered with NGOs and international organizations to provide services to victims and provided in-kind support, including building space, land, and professional staff, to support an international organization in Agadez, and funded research related to traditional slavery with one NGO. International organizations and NGOs provided services to 193 trafficking victims, but had limited capacity to provide shelter or long-term services to all victims. Due to budget constraints, law enforcement officials commonly lacked resources to provide shelter and services, which decreased their ability to identify victims and reduced the government's ability to encourage victims of trafficking to assist in investigations and prosecutions. Victims of forced labor and caste-based servitude could file civil and criminal complaints simultaneously; however, there were no reports they did so during the reporting period. The MOJ and the Office of the Administration of Prisons, with limited support from international organizations, operated treatment and transition centers for child soldiers formerly affiliated with Boko Haram and ISIS-West Africa. In 2017, 52 minors attended the center, and 51 had been reunited with their families. The MOJ provided limited vocational training and psychological support to children. There were no reports that the government penalized victims for unlawful acts committed as a result of being trafficked; however, some victims may have remained unidentified in the law enforcement system due to the failure to employ systematic measures to identify trafficking victims among vulnerable populations. The law provided for the possibility of granting victims legal residency in Niger, including the ability to obtain employment, if it is unsafe for them to return to their countries of origin. The 327NIGERIAANLTPTIM reported that Algeria deported more than 8,200 migrants to Niger, including 1,998 children, during the year. The government coordinated with an international organization to provide temporary shelter, food, and primary health care before assisting in the return of both Nigerien citizens and non-Nigeriens to their home regions and countries. The ANLTPTIM identified 58 trafficking victims among the more than 8,200 migrants, but did not report providing services to those victims. ","recommendation":"Vigorously investigate, prosecute, and convict traffickers, including those engaged in traditional slavery practices, using the 2010 anti-trafficking law; increase training for law enforcement and judicial officials throughout the country on the anti-trafficking law; increase coordination with regional, sub-regional, and international organizations to investigate and prosecute international trafficking cases, separate from smuggling cases; fully adopt and implement systematic procedures for the proactive identification of trafficking victims\u0160especially among vulnerable populations, such as children exploited in sex trafficking, women and girls born into slave castes, and children at worksites\u0160and their subsequent referral to care; direct the Ministry for the Promotion of Women and the Protection of Children to increase efforts to provide support to victims of trafficking, and more closely collaborate with NGOs; provide victims with information about their rights and support victims of trafficking, including forced labor and traditional slavery practices, in seeking redress from, and participating in the prosecution of, their traffickers; amend the law to increase penalties in the 2010 anti-trafficking law for trafficking of adults and in the penal code for forced child begging and child sex 326NIGERtrafficking, and remove the option of imposing a fine in lieu of jail time for forced labor crimes in the labor code; increase the quantity and quality of services available to victims; proactively identify and refer victims of traditional slavery practices to services; raise public awareness about the anti-trafficking law, specifically targeting vulnerable populations, religious leaders, and traditional chiefs; work with international organizations to draft and implement a revised national action plan to combat trafficking in persons; and develop a system among law enforcement, judicial officials, NGOs, and civil society actors to track suspected human trafficking cases and prosecution and protection data. ","tier":"TIER 2 WATCH LIST","traffick_profile":"Niger is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking. Traditional slavery practices perpetuated by politically powerful tribal leaders continue primarily in the northern part of the country. No reliable estimate exists of the number of traditional slaves in the country, though a study in 2003 estimated traditional slavery may affect some 40,000 people. Victims from West and Central Africa are exploited in sex and labor trafficking in Niger. Nigerien boys are subjected to forced labor, including forced begging, within the country and in neighboring countries, especially by corrupt marabouts. Loosely organized clandestine networks may also place Nigerien girls into domestic servitude. Nigerien children are subjected to forced labor in gold, salt, trona, and gypsum mines; agriculture; stone quarries; and manufacturing within the country. In the Tahoua region of Niger, girls born into slavery are sold or given as gifts to men as \ufb01fifth wives,\ufb02 a status in which they are subject to forced labor and sexual servitude, a practice known as wahaya; their children are then born into slave castes which perpetuates the cycle. Traditional chiefs play a primary role in this form of exploitation by arranging \ufb01marriages\ufb02 for other powerful individuals. Some girls in forced marriages may be exploited in commercial sex after fteeing these nominal unions. In Algeria, Nigerien children are forced to beg and Nigerien women and girls are vulnerable to sex trafficking. Nigerien women and children are recruited from Niger and transported to Nigeria, North Africa, the Middle East, and Europe where they are subjected to domestic servitude, sex trafficking, or forced labor in agriculture or animal herding. Some migrants were suspected to be traffickers, particularly Nigerien migrants to Algeria traveling with children unrelated to them. Traffickers operated primarily small, freelance operations in loosely organized networks of individuals. There have been reports of freelance businesspeople (both men and women) and informal travel agencies recruiting women for exploitation in sex trafficking or domestic servitude in the Middle East or northern Nigeria. Niger is a transit country for men, women, and children from West and Central Africa migrating to North Africa and Western Europe, where some are subjected to forced labor or sex trafficking. Increasingly, West African migrants fall victim to traffickers while transiting Niger en route to Libya and Europe. Niger's implementation of its 2015 anti-smuggling law has forced the previously open (albeit illicit) transportation industry underground, which has increased migrants' vulnerability to forced labor or sex trafficking. Nigerian women are transported into neighboring West African countries, and are exploited in sex trafficking inside Niger, especially in northern mining cities or in transportation centers. In some instances, law enforcement and border officials reportedly accepted bribes from traffickers to facilitate the transportation of victims through the country. Boko Haram and ISIS-West Africa forcibly recruit Nigerien boys and girls to serve as child soldiers. According to several reports, the Government of Niger provided some limited material and logistical support within Niger to the Imghad Tuareg and Allies Self-Defense Group (GATIA). GAITIA has been reported to recruit and use child soldiers."},"Nigeria":{"April":85.0,"Asylum Seekers":"92","August":34.0,"December":49.0,"February":48.0,"Friday":72.0,"Global Population":195874.68,"January":108.0,"July":78.0,"June":73.0,"Life Expectancy":54.33,"March":56.0,"May":75.0,"Monday":105.0,"November":32.0,"October":32.0,"Population below $1.90 a day":"53.5","Saturday":105.0,"September":35.0,"Sunday":87.0,"Thursday":101.0,"Tuesday":119.0,"Violence against civilians":705,"Wednesday":116.0,"fatalities":["4","1","5","0","0","0","5","1","5","1","2","1","0","4","17","18","0","0","1","1","4","9","1","0","0","0","0","12","14","1","0","2","0","0","0","0","22","0","1","1","8","0","2","1","0","0","1","2","0","4","0","1","0","0","1","1","0","9","0","1","0","0","3","0","0","1","3","1","15","1","2","1","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","1","0","0","2","0","0","6","0","0","0","3","1","0","0","1","2","1","1","0","12","2","4","1","5","1","5","1","1","0","0","0","19","2","13","1","6","1","5","9","0","0","0","0","5","10","3","3","3","0","1","1","0","3","0","2","0","4","8","3","3","4","4","6","2","0","5","11","1","0","1","3","7","1","1","1","19","3","3","0","1","2","2","4","1","1","0","9","1","2","1","0","3","1","9","9","7","10","8","1","5","2","0","10","0","0","2","1","14","14","1","0","14","1","1","4","1","1","18","1","2","0","0","1","7","7","4","8","4","6","1","0","0","2","1","0","4","5","1","5","2","2","5","5","1","2","3","5","5","5","5","2","5","5","2","1","2","4","2","5","5","5","5","5","5","3","5","2","5","5","0","4","1","1","0","1","1","41","3","5","14","6","2","1","4","4","1","2","0","10","10","10","10","1","5","11","11","11","11","11","11","11","11","11","11","10","10","4","18","5","3","4","0","1","1","1","1","2","1","3","1","1","4","1","1","0","2","1","7","17","1","1","1","2","0","5","5","1","3","1","3","5","8","0","5","5","2","10","0","19","2","1","1","0","23","3","3","4","1","2","0","1","1","2","2","1","0","30","2","1","0","1","7","3","2","0","0","0","2","1","2","0","3","3","3","8","6","6","2","0","1","1","2","1","1","10","2","2","0","2","4","2","0","2","8","22","9","2","2","0","2","2","1","2","1","71","3","0","0","0","0","1","0","5","3","7","8","3","6","1","2","8","1","1","8","7","1","4","1","1","8","19","7","20","19","1","0","18","16","16","6","7","8","15","1","10","1","0","4","4","1","1","1","0","1","0","4","19","5","0","0","20","20","19","5","0","1","3","1","28","28","51","1","22","4","26","0","1","1","7","1","3","4","1","1","11","5","1","5","2","1","2","8","2","1","5","5","5","6","1","4","1","0","1","2","3","2","6","2","1","32","31","2","3","3","2","3","0","3","3","4","2","5","3","2","1","1","2","2","1","25","1","25","25","1","3","7","4","25","0","9","1","16","5","1","1","3","3","2","24","1","0","5","6","3","0","2","0","0","1","1","1","1","0","1","1","0","0","1","1","1","1","0","0","1","0","1","0","1","41","0","0","0","2","1","1","4","1","3","2","1","1","0","0","0","1","5","5","5","5","2","2","5","1","1","4","2","6","5","7","0","1","1","0","5","2","7","1","0","1","7","1","2","3","2","0","3","1","1","3","3","0","5","2","2","1","9","3","3","1","0","3","1","1","1","5","1","0","1","2","1","2","6","3","11","3","1","2","3","3","1","4","0","1","3","6","0","1","2","3","3","2","0","3","20","0","3","3","3","2","14","13","3","2","3","14","14","7","1","1","1","1","0","1","3","0","1","0","6","6","6","6","0","6","7","1","2","6","6","6","6","17","0","1","2","6","6"],"government_effort":"NA","introduction":"The Government of Nigeria does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. The government demonstrated significant efforts during the reporting period by disbursing significantly more funding to the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP); supporting the signing and implementation of a UN action plan to end and prevent the recruitment and use of children by the Civilian Joint Task Force (CJTF); with an international organization, beginning a screening and sensitization campaign to identify and prevent sexual exploitation and abuse of IDPs; and prosecuting three suspected traffickers for child forced begging, although judges ultimately acquitted them. However, the government did not demonstrate overall increasing efforts compared to the previous reporting period. Despite persistent 328NIGERIAand egregious reports of government employees complicit in human trafficking offenses, the government made negligible efforts to address the allegations, and the military generally denied such allegations without investigation. The Nigerian military continued to conduct on-the-ground coordination with the CJTF, a non-governmental self-defense militia that recruited and used children, and which received limited financial and material support from the Borno State government. In addition, the government failed to provide evidence that use of children in support roles in detention in the Giwa Barracks had ceased. The government has never reported an investigation, prosecution, or conviction\u0160including of any government official\u0160for child soldiering offenses. Sexual exploitation of women and girls displaced by Boko Haram and the Islamic State-West Africa (ISIS-WA) remained widespread, including by state security, military personnel, and CJTF, some of whom forced women and girls to provide commercial sex acts in exchange for food and freedom of movement inside IDP camps and others who fraudulently recruited female IDPs for jobs outside of IDP camps but transported them to military barracks for sexual exploitation by Nigerian military personnel. The Nigerian military continued to inappropriately detain, arrest, and interrogate female and child trafficking victims for alleged association with the insurgencies and did not provide trafficking victim protections.

The government appointed a new director general of NAPTIP in April 2017, and NAPTIP continued to lead government efforts to combat trafficking. The inter-ministerial committee on trafficking met several times throughout the year and helped to develop national policies on trafficking, including the first draft of a Protocol for Identification, Safe Return, and Rehabilitation of Trafficked Persons. NAPTIP continued drafting a 2018-2023 national action plan, which was considered by the inter-ministerial committee. NAPTIP continued awareness campaigns at schools, churches, and transit centers, among other places, and significantly expanded media outreach via television and radio to educate the public on the identification and dangers of human trafficking. In response to reports that some individual government employees, service providers, and security officials sexually exploited female IDPs, NAPTIP and an international organization conducted a screening and sensitization campaign in IDP camps around Maiduguri, including all state-run camps, which reportedly led to the arrests of two alleged sex traffickers. NAPTIP also conducted outreach activities in IDP camps in Benue State for persons displaced by mass ftooding and rural violence, worked with local celebrities and social media inftuencers to support the fight against human trafficking, and increased outreach to traditional community and religious leaders to address traffickers' use of the juju oath to coerce victims. After consistent engagement by Edo State government and NAPTIP officials, in March 2018 the Oba of Benin\u0160the most powerful religious ruler in Benin City\u0160issued a curse on sex traffickers and revoked all juju spells that had been administered by priests to bind victims to their traffickers, which could increase victim identification and victims' willingness to participate in trials against their traffickers. The government did not provide sufficient protections for workers employed in the informal economy\u0160including children working in agriculture, domestic work, and artisanal mining\u0160rendering such workers vulnerable to trafficking. In addition, despite identifying 606 child labor violations in 2017, which likely included child forced labor violations, NAPTIP only penalized and referred three exploiters for prosecution. Furthermore, at the close of the reporting period, none of the penalties imposed on the three penalized violators had actually been implemented. NAPTIP began, but did not complete, discussions on how to provide pre-departure information to migrants on available assistance if exploited abroad. The government did not make discernible efforts to reduce the demand for forced labor. To reduce the demand for commercial sex acts, several states maintained prohibitions on soliciting commercial sex. There were reports Nigerians traveled to Togo for child sex tourism.The Borno State government continued to provide financial and in-kind resources to the CJTF, a non-governmental self-defense militia, which according to credible observers continued to use and recruit children. The Borno State government witnessed the signature of, and provided administrative support to help implement, an action plan between CJTF and an international organization to end CJTF's recruitment and use of children. The Nigerian government has publicly criticized and imposed restrictions on those who have portrayed the government in a negative light on human rights, including human trafficking. The government provided anti-trafficking training for its diplomatic personnel and, with foreign donor support, to Nigerian troops prior to their deployment abroad on international peacekeeping missions. A foreign government reported to NAPTIP a Nigerian diplomat suspected of attempted smuggling, trafficking, or both. There were reports that 46 Nigerian soldiers deployed on a UN peacekeeping mission to Liberia exploited 58 women and children, including in sex trafficking. ","prosecution":"The government maintained anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts, but there were continued reports of, and negligible efforts to address, government officials complicit in human trafficking offenses. The Trafficking in Persons Law Enforcement and Administration Act, as amended in 2015, criminalized labor and sex trafficking and prescribed a minimum penalty of five years imprisonment and 1 million naira ($2,790) for both sex and labor trafficking; the minimum penalty for sex trafficking increased to seven years imprisonment if the case involved a child. These penalties were sufficiently stringent and, with regards to sex trafficking, commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. NAPTIP received 662 cases for investigation, completed 116 investigations, prosecuted at least 43 suspects in 43 cases, and convicted 26 traffickers, compared with 654 cases for investigation, 24 prosecutions, and 23 convictions the previous reporting period. NAPTIP did not report how many investigations remained pending, led to prosecutions for other offenses, or had been dismissed at the end of the reporting period. NAPTIP reported newly initiating all 662 investigations during the reporting period but did not report the status of the 630 investigations it had initiated in the previous reporting period. Judges convicted most traffickers under the 2015 anti-trafficking law, although some judges also convicted traffickers under the 2003 anti-trafficking law. Prison sentences upon conviction ranged from six months to 15 years imprisonment. Despite a 2015 amendment that removed judges' ability to sentence traffickers with fines in lieu of imprisonment, Nigerian courts penalized seven traffickers with the option of a fine or imprisonment; this is an increase from the previous reporting period, when judges only penalized one trafficker with the option of a fine. Judges issued fines reportedly due to a lack of familiarity with the 2015 anti-trafficking law and at times due to corruption. The government convicted five labor traffickers, an increase from two labor trafficking convictions the previous reporting period but still not commensurate to the scale of the labor trafficking problem. NAPTIP prosecuted three alleged traffickers for child forced begging, having identified at least 175 child forced begging victims during the reporting period, but judges acquitted all three suspects. The government had convicted one trafficker for child forced begging the previous reporting period. Enforcement of the anti-trafficking law remained ineffective in many parts of the country, and while officials made efforts to address trafficking cases, insufficient resources hampered efforts. The government acknowledged many judges remained insufficiently familiar with the anti-trafficking law\u0160including the provision requiring judges to prescribe sentences that include imprisonment\u0160which hindered law enforcement efforts. In addition, the judiciary remained slow and corrupt generally, which impeded prosecutions and convictions of most crimes, including trafficking. Widespread and pervasive corruption affected all levels of government and the security forces and undermined accountability for trafficking offenses; for example, one NGO reported a suspected trafficking case to police, but the police refused to investigate the case because the NGO did not pay a bribe. There were continued reports of egregious 329NIGERIAtrafficking offenses committed by government officials. Several international organizations and media reported that the sexual exploitation of IDPs in camps, settlements, and host communities around Maiduguri remained a pervasive problem. In more than 14 IDP camps, reports documented government officials, service providers, and security forces, including the Nigerian military and CJTF, who forced IDPs to have sex in exchange for food and freedom of movement in and outside of the camps. As previously reported by media, there were continued reports that camp officials and members of security forces, including some individual Nigerian military personnel, used fraudulent or forced marriages to exploit girls in sex trafficking and new reports that the Nigerian military, CJTF, and other camp officials fraudulently recruited female IDPs for jobs outside of IDP camps but transported them to military barracks for sexual exploitation by Nigerian military personnel. Although NAPTIP reportedly investigated two cases of sexual exploitation of IDPs, which were identified through NAPTIP's sensitization and screening campaign, NAPTIP was unable to investigate or prosecute accusations of trafficking perpetrated by military or law enforcement personnel. The government did not report any prosecutions or convictions for sexual exploitation of IDPs, including children, and did not investigate, prosecute, or convict any government security officials, including military officials alleged to have exploited IDPs. In the previous reporting period, the government had arrested seven government officials and two CJTF members for alleged sexual misconduct towards IDPs, including sex trafficking. During the reporting period, however, no entity could provide information on the status of the investigations, including if they were ongoing, and several law enforcement entities denied knowledge of and responsibility for these cases. Furthermore, despite NAPTIP receiving reports of individual military personnel involved in trafficking crimes, the Nigerian Army categorically denied that any of its personnel used child soldiers or sexually exploited IDPs, which impeded investigation of such reports.As reported by the Secretary-General of the UN, as of May 2016, Nigerian military personnel were using four boys between ages 14 and 16-years-old in support roles. At the close of the reporting period, there was no evidence the government had released these children. The CJTF also reportedly used some child trafficking victims recovered from Boko Haram to lead CJTF and army personnel to Boko Haram camps, putting the children at serious risk for retaliation and denying them trafficking victim care. The government did not report any investigations, prosecutions, or convictions for child soldiering offenses, including of government officials who committed such offenses. Both NAPTIP and the police reported addressing the crime of child soldiering was not within their mandates. NAPTIP arrested two immigration officials at Lagos International Airport for allegedly facilitating travel of six girls to Oman and Kuwait, purportedly for exploitation; the investigation was ongoing at the close of the reporting period. A foreign government reported to NAPTIP a Nigerian diplomat who attempted to secure a visa for their domestic employee by posing as a family member\u0160an indicator of trafficking; neither NAPTIP nor the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported conducting an investigation or taking disciplinary action against the suspect. The government continued an investigation from the previous reporting period of a Department of Petroleum Resources official allegedly complicit in a trafficking offense. There were reports 46 Nigerian soldiers deployed as UN peacekeepers to Liberia sexually exploited 58 women and children from 2003-2017, including in sex trafficking. Some trafficking victims in Libya reported Nigerian embassy officials in Tripoli asked for payment before removing victims from Libyan detention camps. For the fourth consecutive year, the government did not report any prosecutions or convictions of government employees complicit in human trafficking offenses, despite consistent reports of officials committing trafficking offenses each year. Despite 15 years of reports of significant government complicity in human trafficking offenses and trafficking-related corruption, the government has only reported convicting one official for complicity in human trafficking. The government demonstrated significantly more sophisticated collaboration with foreign governments on anti-trafficking cases. It participated in joint investigations with nine countries and assisted 11 other countries through training courses, joint intelligence sharing, and mutual legal assistance on trafficking cases. Through the UK-Nigerian Joint Border Task Force, NAPTIP supported law enforcement to make significant arrests and prosecutions in multiple European countries and improved investigative capacity domestically. The government and a foreign donor trained officials and law enforcement academy instructors on identifying and investigating human trafficking. The government increased NAPTIP's budget by 86 percent over the previous year. Despite this increase, however, NAPTIP did not have sufficient resources given the scale of the problem. For example, the agency did not have resources to carry out sufficient proactive anti-trafficking operations, and NAPTIP officers were often concentrated in state capitals, which hindered identification and investigation of trafficking in rural areas. ","protection":"The government maintained efforts to identify and protect internal trafficking victims and increased efforts to assist Nigerians exploited abroad. The government identified 1,121 potential trafficking victims, including 538 people in prostitution, 203 child labor victims\u0160some of whom were forced\u0160and 188 forced labor victims. This was similar to 1,128 potential trafficking victims (529 people in prostitution, 165 child labor victims, and 434 forced labor victims) identified in the previous reporting period. NAPTIP provided initial care for all trafficking victims, which could have included referrals to government facilities for medical care, shelter, vocational training, or education assistance. NAPTIP did not report how many victims it referred to NGOs for additional care, compared to referring 302 victims to NGOs the previous reporting period. The government had formal written procedures to guide law enforcement, immigration, and social services personnel in proactive identification of trafficking victims among high-risk populations, and NAPTIP trained police, immigration, and social services personnel to identify trafficking victims and direct them to NAPTIP. Additionally, the government's national referral mechanism provided formal guidelines for law enforcement, immigration officials, and service providers to improve protection and assistance to trafficking victims, both within Nigeria and abroad. NAPTIP, in conjunction with an international organization, also developed a referral mechanism specifically for sex trafficking and sexual abuse victims in the Northeast.The government allocated approximately 3.14 billion naira ($8.7 million) to NAPTIP in 2017, a significant increase from 1.69 billion naira ($4.7 million) allocated in 2016. The government disbursed at least 2.64 billion naira ($7.4 million) to NAPTIP during the reporting period, an increase from 1.48 billion naira ($4.1 million) disbursed in the previous reporting period. Although the law mandated NAPTIP to care solely for victims of crimes under the 2015 anti-trafficking law, the government 330NIGERIAoften referred victims of other crimes to NAPTIP, which reduced its capacity to care for trafficking victims. NAPTIP opened a new zonal command and victim shelter during the reporting period, increasing its total to 10 shelters for trafficking victims with a total capacity of 315, compared to nine shelters with a combined capacity of 313 the previous reporting period. NAPTIP required victims to go to its shelters for short-term care and determined how long victims were required to stay, while also requiring their support in law enforcement investigations. NAPTIP staff did not permit victims to leave shelters without a chaperone, which limited victims' freedom of movement and educational and work opportunities. Because NAPTIP operated closed shelters, it referred school-aged victims to foster care so they could attend school. NAPTIP generally limited victims' stays to six weeks, although victims could extend their stays under special circumstances; both men and women received specialized care. Through these shelters, NAPTIP provided access to legal, medical, and psychological services, as well as vocational training, financial empowerment, and business management skills. These shelters were also available to Nigerian trafficking victims exploited abroad upon repatriation. NAPTIP had agreements with certain hospitals and clinics to provide additional medical and psychological treatment for victims, as needed. Additional government and NGO shelters provided services, including long-term shelter, to vulnerable children and victims of crime, including trafficking; authorities sometimes assigned child trafficking victims to foster homes or orphanages for care. Foreign victims had access to the same services as domestic victims. In contrast with previous years, for the second consecutive year NAPTIP did not report providing funding, in-kind donations, or services to NGOs and other organizations that provided protection and services to trafficking victims. NAPTIP authorities sometimes deemed adults in prostitution, who claimed to be working voluntarily, trafficking victims and detained them in shelter facilities against their will. In response to continued reports of sexual exploitation of IDPs in the Northeast, NAPTIP partnered with an international organization to create and implement a screening and sensitization campaign to identify sex trafficking victims. NAPTIP reached at least 14 camps in the Maiduguri area\u0160including all 13 state-run IDP camps\u0160with screening, sensitization, or both. In response to a large number of Nigerian migrants stranded in Libya, including some trafficking victims, the government created an inter-ministerial committee to facilitate repatriation and resettlement in Nigeria for those migrants; in January 2018, the government repatriated more than 1,501 Nigerians from Libya and, with funding from a foreign donor, provided some reintegration assistance. The inftux of migrants returned from Libya, some of whom were trafficking victims, overwhelmed the shelter and service system, including NAPTIP facilities, and not all trafficking victims received care. During the reporting period, the governor of Edo State created the Edo State Task Force (ESTF), chaired by the state attorney general, to combat transnational trafficking of Nigerians to Europe in one of the regions of Nigeria most affected. Its mandate included investigation and prosecution of trafficking cases, alongside NAPTIP, and coordinating national and international actors' protection and reintegration efforts for returning trafficking victims. ESTF increased coordination among victim protection actors and screened some returnees from Libya for trafficking and referred the identified trafficking victims to NAPTIP facilities. The Edo State government allocated additional funding for victim protection, including 36,000 naira ($100) to 200 trafficking or smuggling victims repatriated from Libya. Several Nigerian embassies, particularly within West Africa, provided funding or in-kind support to repatriate Nigerian trafficking victims exploited abroad. Victims and activists, however, reported some Nigerian embassies did not always assist trafficking victims with removal from situations of exploitation or law enforcement efforts against their traffickers, which impeded access to care and justice. One Nigerian embassy reportedly stopped issuing identity documents to Nigerian trafficking victims seeking repatriation, which required NGOs and the host government to provide such documents and facilitate repatriation.Although the anti-trafficking law prohibited the penalization of trafficking victims for unlawful acts committed as a result of being subjected to trafficking, multiple credible international organizations reported the government continued to arrest and in some cases inappropriately detain for prolonged periods, reportedly for screening and perceived intelligence value, women and children removed from or allegedly associated with Boko Haram and ISIS-WA, including women and girls who had been forcibly married to or sexually enslaved by the insurgents; authorities did not screen for trafficking. The military, in cooperation with an international organization, released some adults and children from detention but also newly detained other children during the reporting period. The government began working with an international organization to develop standard procedures to refer children identified in armed conftict to civilian care providers. After release from detention, the military generally referred women and children classified through a security screening process as \ufb01low risk\ufb02 or \ufb01inactive\ufb02 in the conftict to a government-run rehabilitation center. While the process improved identification of potential trafficking victims among those detained, some trafficking victims\u0160including women and children forced to be combatants\u0160remained in the detention system and subject to criminal prosecution for crimes committed as a result of being subjected to trafficking. International organizations provided medical care, psycho-social support, education, and nutritional services through a 12-week rehabilitation program at the center. The government also had a separate 16-week deradicalization and rehabilitation program for individuals classified as both \ufb01low risk\ufb02 and \ufb01surrendered.\ufb02 Some women and child ex-combatants participated in this program, in addition to men, and the project remained in development at the end of the reporting period. The government adopted a communique and national action plan on DDR for persons formerly associated with Boko Haram or ISIS-WA, including children. Officials encouraged victims to assist in the investigation and prosecution of trafficking cases but did not report how many did so during the reporting period, compared with 43 victims who served as witnesses or gave evidence during trial in the previous reporting period. The government did not have a formal policy to prevent the removal of victims to countries where they would face hardship or retribution; there were no reports of trafficking victims removed to such countries during the reporting period. It could grant temporary residence visas to a trafficking victim that had a pending criminal, civil, or other legal action; the government did not report that any foreign victims requested this relief during the reporting period. The victims' trust fund, financed primarily through confiscated assets of convicted traffickers, was available to all victims. The government did not allocate any funding to or disburse funding from the fund during the reporting period, although overall spending on victim support through the normal budget process increased. In the previous reporting period, it had allocated 2.5 million naira ($6,960) to and disbursed 5.6 million naira ($15,600) from the fund to provide vocational training and school tuition to trafficking victims. The anti-trafficking law provided for victim restitution and allowed victims to file 331NIGERIAcivil suits against their traffickers. While NAPTIP prosecutors regularly sought restitution in trafficking cases, NAPTIP did not report successfully receiving restitution for victims in any cases, largely because judges were unfamiliar with that provision of the anti-trafficking law. ","recommendation":"Ensure the Nigerian military has ceased unlawful use of children, including in collaboration with CJTF, and investigate any reports of military personnel's use of children; work with CJTF and the UN to implement fully the child soldier action plan to remove all children from CJTF's ranks and, if it is not, cut provision of financial and in-kind support to CJTF; vigorously investigate, prosecute, and convict traffickers\u0160including complicit officials, those who recruit and use child soldiers and sexually exploit IDPs, and labor traffickers, including those who force children to beg\u0160and impose sufficiently stringent sentences involving imprisonment; expand existing efforts to identify trafficking victims among IDPs, investigate cases, and implement preventative measures; release those suspected child ex-combatants and women who are inappropriately detained, screen for trafficking among those detained, and provide appropriate care; further increase funding for NAPTIP, particularly to provide adequate victim care; increase investigations into forced begging in Quranic schools; finalize the draft protocol to hand children identified in armed conftict over to civilian authorities; implement programs for the disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) of child ex-combatants that take into account their specific needs, and work with the Nigerian military and CJTF to implement these plans; increase training for judges on the 2015 law, specifically the provision prohibiting the issuance of fines in lieu of imprisonment; allow trafficking victims to obtain employment and move freely in and out of NAPTIP shelters; expand ongoing police and immigration training to include identifying trafficking victims among vulnerable populations, such as women in prostitution and young females traveling with non-family members; increase the capacity of Nigerian embassies to identify and provide assistance to victims abroad, including by providing replacement travel or identity documents free of charge; and provide pre-departure information for migrants on how to find assistance if exploited abroad.","tier":"TIER 2 WATCH LIST","traffick_profile":"As reported over the past five years, Nigeria is a source, transit, and destination country for women and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking, and a source country for men subjected to forced labor. Nigerian trafficking victims are recruited from rural areas\u0160especially the country's southern regions\u0160and, to a lesser extent, urban areas. Women and girls are victims of domestic servitude and sex trafficking, and boys are victims of forced and bonded labor in street vending, domestic service, mining, stone quarrying, agriculture, textile manufacturing, and begging. The government estimates as many as 9.5 million young boys studying in Quranic schools, commonly known as Almajiri, are subjected to forced begging. Traffickers operate \ufb01baby factories\ufb02\u0160often disguised as orphanages, maternity homes, or religious centers\u0160where traffickers hold women against their will, rape them, and force them to carry and deliver a child. The traffickers sell the children, sometimes with the intent to exploit them in forced labor and sex trafficking. In southern Nigeria, especially Lagos, some women drug and \ufb01rent\ufb02 their infants out to street beggars to increase the beggars' profits; in at a least one case, an infant died from a drug overdose. Nigerian traffickers take women and children to other West and Central African countries\u0160including Mali, Senegal, Cote d'Ivoire, and Cabo Verde\u0160as well as to South Africa, where they are exploited in forced labor and sex trafficking. Nigerian women and children are recruited and transported to destinations in North Africa, the Middle East\u0160including Saudi Arabia, Oman, and United Arab Emirates\u0160and Central Asia, and held captive in commercial sexual exploitation or forced labor. West African children are subjected to forced labor in Nigeria, including in granite and gold mines. Women from West African countries transit Nigeria en route to Europe and the Middle East, where they are forced into prostitution. Nigeria's ports and waterways around Calabar are transit points for West African children subjected to forced labor in Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, and Gabon. Nigerians travel to Togo for child sex tourism.Authorities identified Nigerian trafficking victims\u0160often exploited by Nigerian traffickers\u0160in at least 40 countries during the reporting period. Nigerian women and girls are subjected to sex trafficking within Nigeria and throughout Europe, including in Italy, Spain, Austria, and Russia; an international organization estimated 80 percent of all female Nigerian migrants in Italy are or will become sex trafficking victims. In 2015, a foreign government reported that with the exception of internal trafficking within the EU, Nigerian nationals are the most common trafficking victims in the EU. The majority of Nigerian trafficking victims in Europe come from Edo State, via Libya. One local press report noted that traffickers recruit women and girls from IDP camps in Northeast Nigeria for ostensibly legitimate jobs in Italy but exploit them in prostitution in Italy. Nigerian sex traffickers operate in highly organized criminal webs throughout Europe, and many sex trafficking victims begin to work for their traffickers in exchange for leaving sex trafficking themselves. Before departure for work abroad, many Nigerian women participate in a traditional ceremony with a juju priest; 332NORWAYsome traffickers exploit this tradition and tell the women they must obey their traffickers or a curse will harm them, which prevents victims from seeking assistance or cooperating with law enforcement. While some sex trafficking victims arrive in Europe believing they will be working in prostitution, traffickers coerce them to stay in prostitution by changing the working conditions and increasing victims' travel debts. Some victims' parents encourage them to obey their traffickers and endure exploitation to earn money. Nigerians are increasingly exploited in Libya\u0160by both Libyans and Nigerians\u0160in forced labor in construction, agriculture, and prostitution in Tripoli, Sabha, Benghazi, and Misrata. Lured by the promise of reaching Europe, traffickers keep victims in \ufb01control houses\ufb02 or \ufb01prostitution camps\ufb02 located on the outskirts of Tripoli and Misrata until they can repay travel debts; sometimes before victims repay the debt, traffickers sell them again. Some trafficking victims in Libya reported Nigerian embassy officials in Tripoli asked for payment before removing victims from Libyan detention camps. In 2017, an international organization repatriated more than 4,316 Nigerians from Libya, some of whom were trafficking victims or vulnerable to trafficking; 4,000 had departed from Edo State. There were reports of re-trafficking among the trafficking victims repatriated from Libya. A foreign government estimated as many as 20,000 Nigerians await repatriation from Libya, some of whom are trafficking victims. ISIS has captured Nigerian women and girls in Libya and exploited them in sexual slavery. Criminal gangs\u0160some of whom might have had ties to so-called student cults\u0160partner with organized crime networks to transport Nigerians to Europe for exploitation. As in past years, reports continue to indicate government officials and security forces commit widespread sexual exploitation\u0160including sex trafficking\u0160and such exploitation is a major concern across the Northeast, including in informal IDP camps and all of the 13 formal, state-run IDP camps in and around Maiduguri, the Borno State capital, which hosts IDPs affected by the ongoing conftict with Boko Haram and ISIS-WA. \ufb01Gatekeepers\ufb02 in control of some IDP camps, at times in collusion with Nigerian policemen and soldiers, reportedly force women and girls to provide sex acts in exchange for food and services in the camps. In July 2016, a Nigerian research organization surveyed 400 IDPs in Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe states, and 66 percent said camp officials sexually abused women and girls, some of which constitutes sex trafficking. As previously reported by media, there were continued reports that camp officials and members of security forces, including some individual Nigerian military personnel, used fraudulent or forced marriages to exploit girls in sex trafficking. Some Nigerian military personnel and CJTF members promised female IDPs jobs but instead took them to military barracks for sexual exploitation by Nigerian military personnel. Various NGOs and news outlets report that children in IDP camps are victims of labor and sex trafficking, and some alleged that government officials managing the camps are complicit in these activities. Media and an international organization reported Cameroonian soldiers coerced Nigerian female refugees in a Cameroon refugee camp to have sex in exchange for food or protection from deportation.Boko Haram and ISIS-WA continued to forcibly recruit, abduct, and use child soldiers as young as 12-years-old as cooks, spies, messengers, bodyguards, armed combatants, and increasingly as suicide bombers in attacks in Nigeria, Cameroon, and Chad. In 2017, Boko Haram used at least 158 children as human bombers, significantly more than 19 used in all of 2016. The groups continue to abduct women and girls in the northern region of Nigeria, some of whom they subject to domestic servitude and forced labor. Boko Haram routinely forces girls to choose between forced marriages to its fighters\u0160for the purpose of sexual slavery\u0160or becoming suicide bombers. In some cases, Boko Haram forced child soldiers to marry one another. International organizations continue to express concerns about the arrest and detention of children by the Nigerian military for alleged association with Boko Haram. The government continued to arrest and, in some cases, inappropriately detain for prolonged periods, reportedly for screening and perceived intelligence value, women and children removed from or allegedly associated with Boko Haram and ISIS-WA, including women and girls who had been forcibly married to or sexually enslaved by the insurgents. For example, as previously reported, in 2016, the government detained and considered to be combatants at least 78 child trafficking victims aged 13-17-years-old. As previously reported, the Nigerian military unlawfully used children as young as 12 years old in support roles such as messengers, porters, and guards and failed to provide evidence these activities had ceased. The Nigerian military interrogated children in detention for later use as collaborators to identify Boko Haram members among newly arrested persons. As reported by the Secretary-General of the UN, as of May 2016, Nigerian military personnel were using four boys between ages 14 and 16-years-old in support roles. At the close of the reporting period, there was no evidence the government had released these children. The Nigerian military also conducted on-the-ground coordination with the CJTF, a non-governmental self-defense militia that received state government funding and continued to recruit and use children in support roles. Media reported that the CJTF also used some child trafficking victims recovered from Boko Haram to lead CJTF and army personnel to Boko Haram camps, putting the children at serious risk for retaliation and denying them trafficking victim care. CJTF continued to recruit and use children. As previously reported, CJTF has recruited children as young as 12-years-old to man checkpoints, conduct patrols, search and arrest suspected insurgents, guard IDP camps, and gather intelligence, at times in collaboration with the Nigerian military. As of March 2018, CJTF and an international organization compiled a list of children potentially associated with CJTF and were in the process of interviewing the children and separating those associated with the group."},"Pakistan":{"April":17.0,"Asylum Seekers":"77","August":39.0,"December":37.0,"February":6.0,"Friday":58.0,"Global Population":212228.29,"January":7.0,"July":41.0,"June":29.0,"Life Expectancy":67.11,"March":7.0,"May":14.0,"Monday":38.0,"November":30.0,"October":54.0,"Population below $1.90 a day":"3.9","Saturday":48.0,"September":38.0,"Sunday":46.0,"Thursday":43.0,"Tuesday":44.0,"Violence against civilians":319,"Wednesday":42.0,"fatalities":["1","1","1","1","1","4","1","1","0","1","1","0","2","1","1","1","2","1","2","0","0","1","1","0","1","1","2","0","1","0","1","0","1","1","1","2","2","0","0","1","1","0","1","2","0","1","0","0","1","0","0","1","2","1","0","0","0","1","2","1","0","1","1","0","0","1","0","1","4","5","0","0","1","2","0","1","1","1","1","0","0","4","2","0","1","1","0","0","1","1","0","2","1","1","1","1","1","1","0","1","1","0","1","0","0","0","1","1","1","1","2","1","1","2","1","1","1","1","0","1","1","0","0","1","1","1","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","1","1","0","3","1","0","2","0","1","0","2","0","0","2","0","1","4","1","1","0","0","2","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","2","1","1","1","0","2","2","1","1","1","1","0","0","1","1","1","1","0","0","1","0","3","0","2","5","0","0","0","0","0","1","1","1","1","1","2","1","0","1","1","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","7","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","2","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","1","1","0","0","0","1","1","1","1","0","0","6","5","1","0","0","1","3","0","1","1","1","0","0","1","2","0","1","0","1","0","1","0","3","0","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","0","0","3","6","3","4","2","3","0","2","0","1","1","0","2","0","0","0","1","1","4","1","0","1","1","0","2","0","1","0","1","1","1","1","1","1","0","4","2","1","1","0"],"government_effort":"NA","introduction":"The Government of Pakistan does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. The government demonstrated increasing efforts compared to the previous reporting period; therefore Pakistan was upgraded to Tier 2. The government demonstrated increasing efforts by increasing the number of victims it identified and investigations and prosecutions of sex trafficking. The provincial government of Punjab increased investigations, prosecutions, and convictions for bonded labor, the country's largest human trafficking problem. The government of Azad Jammu and Kashmir adopted a law prohibiting bonded labor. The governments of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Sindh reported operating two additional women's shelters and three additional child protection units, respectively. The government continued to implement its 2015-2020 national strategic framework against trafficking in persons and migrant smuggling. However, the government did not meet the minimum standards in several key areas. Overall government law enforcement efforts on labor trafficking remained inadequate compared with the scale of the problem; Punjab continued to be the only province to report prosecutions and convictions for bonded labor. Convictions for sex trafficking decreased and the government's overall convictions remained small compared with the extent of trafficking in Pakistan. Official complicity in trafficking crimes remained a pervasive problem, yet the government did not report new law enforcement efforts to hold such officials accountable, including failing to investigate serious allegations of trafficking regarding a high-ranking diplomatic official. Government protection efforts remained inconsistent; only a small number of the total victims identified were referred to assistance services.

The government reported its continued implementation of the 2015-2020 national strategic framework against trafficking in persons and migrant smuggling. Provincial governments continued to allocate resources for development-related labor programs, some of which were specific to the prevention of bonded labor. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's labor department dedicated 7 million PKR ($63,410) for specialized inspection teams within its office on child and bonded labor. Punjab continued to implement its multi-year project to eliminate child and bonded labor. Punjab prosecuted 1,516 brick kiln owners for lack of compliance with labor laws, including non-payment and illegal deductions from wages, and imposed fines totaling 519,000 PKR ($4,700), compared with the prosecution of 3,989 brick kiln owners during the previous reporting period. Punjab's labor department continued to operate a hotline to report labor violations, including child labor in brick kilns and to remove children working in brick kilns and admit them to school; the Punjab government reported at the end of the reporting period it supported 87,013 children in school. The provincial governments of Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab, and Sindh continued to fund and implement multi-year programs focused on combating the worst forms of child labor and other labor abuses. Punjab continued to implement a birth registration program for brick kiln workers. FIA's research and analysis center published quarterly newsletters with statistics and information on the government's efforts to combat trafficking and smuggling. The Bureau of Emigration and Overseas Employment (BEOE) monitored overseas migration by issuing licenses to private employment promoters and monitoring workers who migrate through their own arrangements. The Emigration Ordinance of 1979 prohibited the role of unregulated and unregistered sub-agents; however, sub-agents continued to operate widely with impunity. The government allowed licensed employment promoters to charge migrant workers a service fee of 6,000 PKR ($54) and workers to pay all the costs associated with overseas employment. While the government stipulated a receipt should be issued to the migrant workers for these costs, the government did not specify any cost limit and the BEOE did not consistently review migrant workers' receipts\u0160in 2016, an international organization's research revealed more than 80 percent of Pakistani workers' cost for employment in Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates was the result of exorbitant visa fees. BEOE reported it canceled 29 licenses of registered employment promoters and suspended 41 during the reporting period but it did not provide details of the promoter's violations. The government continued to ban female migrant workers under the age of 35 from migrating for domestic work. The UN and members of civil society argued any ban on female migration increased the likelihood such women would migrate illegally and therefore heightened their vulnerability to human trafficking. BEOE required migrant workers to attend a pre-departure briefing at one of its seven offices that included information on what to do if the migrant worker encountered problems; however, observers asserted the government did not take sufficient steps to inform emigrants about trafficking even though a number of migrant workers become trafficking victims. FIA partnered with an international organization to run an awareness campaign in Punjab and Balochistan against migrant smuggling and human trafficking. The Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Punjab governments reported providing information to the public on migrant smuggling and human trafficking, but did not provide details on how many potential migrant workers were reached. BEOE employed 21 community welfare attach\u00e9s in 15 destination countries to provide support and information to Pakistani migrant workers; the government did not report how many Pakistani victims abroad the attach\u00e9s identified or assisted. In July 2017, the governments of Pakistan and Afghanistan partnered to provide Afghan Citizen Cards (ACCs) to the estimated one million undocumented Afghans living in Pakistan. The government received approximately 880,000 applications for ACCs, which provided legal protection from deportation under Pakistan's Foreigner's Act, and as of March 2018 had distributed 308,000 ACCs, valid through June 30, 2018. The government also granted previously registered Afghan refugees an extension of proof of registration cards until June 30, 2018; however, during the reporting period, there were reports of harassment and extortion of Afghan refugees by Pakistani provincial authorities, police, and host communities. In 2016, media reported some undocumented Afghan nationals who returned to Afghanistan due to alleged threats from Pakistani law enforcement were subjected to bonded labor in brick kilns in Afghanistan after being unable to pay their transportation cost from Pakistan. The government made efforts to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts. The government did not make overall efforts to reduce the 340PALAUdemand for forced labor, although the provincial government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa reported targeting more than 1,000 employers through trafficking awareness raising events. The government provided anti-trafficking training for its diplomatic and peacekeeping personnel. Pakistan is not a party to the 2000 UN TIP Protocol.","prosecution":"The government maintained law enforcement efforts against trafficking. Pakistani law did not criminalize all forms of sex and labor trafficking. Section 369A of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) amended in March 2016, criminalized transnational and internal forced labor and transnational and internal sex trafficking of women and children. Inconsistent with international law, Section 369A required a demonstration of force, fraud, or coercion to constitute a child sex trafficking offense, and therefore did not criminalize all forms of child sex trafficking. Section 369A prescribed penalties ranging from five to seven years imprisonment, or a fine between 500,000 and 700,000 Pakistani rupees (PKR) ($4,530 and $6,340), or both. These penalties were sufficiently stringent but, with respect to sex trafficking, were not commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. Several other sections of the PPC criminalized some forms of human trafficking, such as slavery and selling or buying a minor for the purpose of prostitution; maximum penalties for these offenses range from a maximum of five years to life imprisonment. These prescribed penalties were sufficiently stringent and, with regard to sex trafficking, were commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. Transnational sex and labor trafficking offenses, as well as some non-trafficking crimes such as migrant smuggling and fraudulent adoption, were criminalized in the Prevention and Control of Human Trafficking Ordinance (PACHTO), which prescribed penalties of seven to 14 years imprisonment. Prescribed penalties for PACHTO offenses were sufficiently stringent and with respect to sex trafficking, commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. The Bonded Labor System (Abolition) Act (BLSA) criminalized bonded labor, with prescribed penalties ranging from two to five years imprisonment, a fine, or both; these penalties were sufficiently stringent. Most of the provincial governments have adopted their own labor laws under a devolution process that began in 2010, although federal laws apply until corresponding provincial laws are enacted. During the reporting period, the government of Azad Jammu and Kashmir adopted the BLSA, joining the provinces of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab, and Sindh. The National Assembly held multiple hearings during the reporting period to solicit input on a draft comprehensive trafficking bill that would take effect for all regions upon enactment; at the end of the reporting period the bill was in committee for review. The government reported investigating 90 alleged traffickers, prosecuting 53, and convicting 29 under PACHTO in 2017, compared with investigating 98 alleged traffickers, prosecuting 60, and convicting 25 in 2016. Despite efforts to differentiate human trafficking and migrant smuggling in law and policies, some law enforcement officials continued to confuse the two crimes and may have reported statistics conftating them, as PACHTO criminalized both trafficking and smuggling. The government also reported data on trafficking investigations, prosecutions, and convictions under the penal code by province and special administrative area. Overall, the government reported investigating 6,376 alleged sex traffickers and prosecuting 6,232 during the reporting period, an increase from 2,979 alleged sex traffickers investigated and 2,021 prosecuted during the previous reporting period. The government's overall conviction of sex traffickers decreased from 111 to 72 during the reporting period, although the government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa reported five sex trafficking convictions compared with zero during the last two reporting periods. Punjab continued to report the vast majority of law enforcement action against sex trafficking; of the national statistics on sex trafficking, 95 percent of investigations and prosecutions and 93 percent of convictions took place in Punjab. The government's law enforcement action on labor trafficking remained inadequate compared with the scale of forced and bonded labor in Pakistan although overall investigations, prosecutions, and convictions for bonded labor increased in Punjab. While the Islamabad Capital Territory reported one investigation on bonded labor, Punjab remained the only province to report legal action under the BLSA during the reporting period. Punjab provincial authorities reported investigating 264 alleged traffickers, prosecuting 257, and convicting 37 traffickers for bonded labor, a significant increase compared with 27 alleged traffickers investigated, 12 prosecuted and 10 traffickers convicted during the previous reporting period. An international organization stated the BLSA was not adequately enforced countrywide because of police inaction on complaints and lower court judges' lack of understanding of the BLSA. Media reported three police raids on farms in Sindh, resulting in the release of 80 men, women, and children from bonded labor and one raid in Islamabad releasing 15 family members from bonded labor in a brick kiln; while the media stated charges were filed in the Islamabad case, the government and media did not report if charges were filed in the Sindh cases. Punjab was also the only province that reported taking law enforcement action under PPC section 374, unlawful compulsory labor, and section 338PAKISTAN369A, trafficking in human beings. Under section 374, Punjab reported the investigation and prosecution of four alleged traffickers during the reporting period. Punjab reported the investigation of 114 and prosecution of 112 alleged traffickers and the conviction of 17 traffickers under section 369A; it did not disaggregate these cases between sex and labor trafficking. The government of Sindh's law enforcement efforts on labor trafficking decreased during the reporting period with a total of three alleged traffickers investigated and three prosecuted under PPC sections 370, buying or disposing of any person as a slave, and 371, habitual dealing in slaves, compared with 19 alleged traffickers investigated and 16 prosecuted in the previous reporting period. The government also reported data on several penal code sections that criminalized other non-trafficking crimes in addition to labor trafficking but did not disaggregate the data to document its specific efforts to combat forced labor under these penal codes. The government did not report individual sentences for any of the convictions. The government's lead reporting and coordinating entity on human trafficking remained the Federal Investigative Agency (FIA), despite its statutorily limited jurisdiction on human trafficking encompassing only crimes punishable under PACHTO, which was focused on transnational offenses. FIA investigated human trafficking and migrant smuggling cases through its 27 anti-trafficking law enforcement joint task forces at the federal, provincial, and local level. FIA's basic training for new recruits included information on human trafficking and migrant smuggling. FIA also reported 17 law enforcement officers participated in six anti-trafficking trainings in 2017 held by foreign governments or international organizations; FIA contributed in-kind support to some trainings. Official complicity in trafficking remained a significant concern as the government did not report vigorous efforts to address credible allegations and has not reported the conviction of an official found to be complicit in trafficking crimes for ten years. Some feudal landlords and brick kiln owners were affiliated with political parties or held official positions and reportedly used their inftuence to protect their involvement in bonded labor. In some cases, when bonded laborers attempted to escape or seek legal redress, police refused to file a case and some police even returned bonded laborers to their traffickers. NGOs continued to report perpetrators of bonded labor successfully filed false charges against victims leading to their arrest and imprisonment. Some police reportedly acted against trafficking only when pressured by media and activists, and other reports indicated police accepted bribes to ignore prostitution crimes, some of which may have included sex trafficking. In November 2016, members of the Gilgit-Baltistan Legislative Assembly and senior officials from Gilgit-Baltistan were accused in media reports of involvement in a child sex trafficking ring; the government appointed a committee of members of the Gilgit-Baltistan assembly to investigate the allegations but did not report the outcome of the investigation. In January 2017, an Islamabad High Court judge was suspended and indicted for allegedly subjecting a 10-year-old girl to torture and domestic servitude; at the end of the reporting period the case was under trial. In February 2018, Australian media reported the High Commissioner for Pakistan in Australia had been accused of subjecting her domestic worker to forced labor for 18 months; the government of Australia investigated the allegations and granted the victim protected status. The Government of Pakistan did not report criminally or administratively investigating these claims. ","protection":"The government increased victim identification but demonstrated mixed efforts to protect and assist victims. The government reported law enforcement, immigration, and social service personnel had SOPs for the identification of trafficking victims within their respective departments; however, it is unknown how widely such SOPs were disseminated and if officials regularly used SOPs for victim identification. The government did not report training provincial officials, other than immigration officers, on victim identification. The government reported identifying victims at both the federal and provincial level; overall, it identified a total of 14,588 victims, an increase compared with 4,649 victims identified in 2016. FIA's anti-trafficking units reported identifying 17 Pakistani victims and no foreign victims in 2017, compared with 131 Pakistani victims in 2016. Provincial police reported identifying 14,571 victims in 2017, of which 12,133 were women, 2,133 were men, and 107 were children. This was a significant increase in the identification of women victims compared with the identification of 2,134 women, 2,184 men, and 200 children victims in 2016. The government did not report which form of trafficking the victims were subjected to or disaggregate the number of victims identified by province. In part due to lack of dissemination and training on SOPs, authorities may have charged sex trafficking victims with moral crimes. NGOs accused some law enforcement officials of allowing false charges against bonded laborers to be brought by brick kiln or landowners. The government reported referring victims to care through various agencies and at both the federal and provincial level. It reported referring to care a total of 303 victims, compared with 351 in 2016. FIA reported it referred the 17 victims it identified to NGO-run shelter and rehabilitation services; however, provincial police referred only 286 of the 14,571 victims they identified to rehabilitative care and did not report what happened to the other 14,285 victims. Civil society continued to provide victim services without government support. Government-run shelters were available to women experiencing a range of difficult circumstances, including trafficking victims. Punjab reported all 36 district women's shelters in the province were operational. Sindh province operated three women's shelters in its 29 districts and also operated four centers that offered women in distress medical and legal aid and shelter for up to 72 hours. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa reported six of its 26 districts had women's shelters, an increase of two during the reporting period, and Balochistan reported it operated one women's shelter in its 32 districts. NGOs and local politicians noted concerns about the quality of government victim care services and lack of resources. NGOs also noted government women's shelters limited victims' freedom of movement and, in the recent past, traffickers forced some of the women in government shelters into prostitution. Punjab continued to operate its wholly integrated center providing shelter; medical and psychological support for female victims of violence; and facilities for law enforcement, judicial officials, and a courtroom. While the center was open to all female victims of violence, including trafficking victims, it did not report receiving referrals for trafficking victims. Provincial child protection units (CPUs) in Punjab, Sindh, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa identified and referred children in exploitative or vulnerable labor situations to NGO and government care. Sindh reported it operated 15 CPUs, an increase of three during the reporting period. Balochistan did not report if it had established any CPUs despite passing legislation in November 2016 to establish such units in all districts. Boys could access government shelters; however, the government did not fund shelters for males over the age of 18. The Punjab 339PAKISTANChild Protection and Welfare Bureau (CPWB) housed children in child protection shelters. CPWB operated open reception centers to identify and register children living on the street; during 2017, the centers identified and referred 6,474 child beggars to services, compared with 1,457 children in 2016. Authorities did not report how many of these children were identified as victims of forced begging. CPWB also identified and removed 17 children from domestic servitude. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa continued to fund and operate a 1,000 bed shelter for homeless children. The BLSA required districts to establish bonded labor vigilance committees (DVCs) to ensure the implementation of the BLSA and provide assistance to bonded labor victims. The government of Punjab reported its DVCs held 83 meetings during the reporting period. NGOs noted the Sindh government, in particular, had not implemented the BLSA or established the required DVCs. It is unknown if DVCs set up under the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa BLSA were operational during the reporting period. Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provided free legal aid to bonded laborers who requested help. Bonded laborers who were released but lacked identity documents were unable to access government services, including health care and food stipends, and sometimes returned to brick kilns or farms and assumed more debt. Punjab's labor department issued 21,567 identity documents to brick kiln workers during the reporting period, which allowed them to access government benefits and reduced the vulnerability to trafficking. NGO-run shelters were available to bonded laborers, including entire families. The government reported it provided protection to victims to encourage their cooperation in investigations; however, it did not report how many it provided such protection to in 2017 and it is unclear how often protection was available or adequate. Victims expressed reluctance to testify against their traffickers due to threats of violence against them and their families. The Ministry of Interior had the authority to grant extensions for foreign victims to stay in the country until a decision was reached on the victims' repatriation by the Federal Review Board of the Supreme Court; however, it is unclear if this policy allowed permanent legal alternatives to removal to countries in which victims would face retribution or hardship. ","recommendation":"Increase prosecutions and convictions, particularly of forced and bonded labor, while strictly respecting due process; pass an anti-trafficking law that criminalizes all forms of human trafficking, including sex trafficking of those under 18 without requiring coercive means, and prescribes penalties commensurate with other serious crimes, such as rape; thoroughly investigate credible allegations of government complicity in trafficking and stringently prosecute and punish officials who are complicit; provide additional resources to increase trafficking-specific services for victims, including for men and boys, and ensure victims are not penalized for acts committed as a result of being subjected to trafficking; ensure the creation, dissemination, and use of standard operating procedures (SOPs) for victim identification and referral to rehabilitation services at the provincial level; expand ability for freed bonded laborers to obtain identification documents and gain access to government services; take steps to eliminate all recruitment fees charged to workers; issue policies and provide trainings to government officials that clearly distinguish between human trafficking and migrant smuggling; strengthen the capacity of provincial governments to address human trafficking, including bonded labor, through training, awareness raising, funding, and encouraging the creation of coordination task forces and the adoption of provincial-level anti-trafficking action plans; lift current bans on female migration to discourage migration through undocumented channels; improve efforts to collect, analyze, and accurately report anti-trafficking data, distinct from data on smuggling; and accede to the 2000 UN TIP Protocol.","tier":"TIER 2","traffick_profile":"As reported over the last five years, Pakistan is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking. The country's largest human trafficking problem is bonded labor, in which an initial debt assumed by a worker as part of the terms of employment is exploited, ultimately entrapping other family members, sometimes for generations. Bonded labor is concentrated in Sindh and Punjab provinces, but also occurs in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces, in agriculture and brick-making and, to a lesser extent, in fisheries, mining, and handicraft- and carpet-making. Some feudal landlords and brick kiln owners affiliated with political parties use their inftuence to protect their involvement in bonded labor. Children are bought, sold, rented, or kidnapped and placed in organized begging rings, domestic servitude, small shops, brick kilns, and sex trafficking. According to a prominent child rights NGO, the majority of children living on the street in Pakistan are subjected to forced begging. Begging ringmasters sometimes maim children to earn more money. NGOs report boys are subjected to sex trafficking around hotels, truck stops, bus stations, and shrines. Illegal labor agents charge high recruitment fees to parents in return for employing their children, some of whom are subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking. Trafficking experts describe a structured system for exploiting women, girls, and LGBTI individuals in sex trafficking, including offering victims for sale in physical markets. Observers report police accept bribes to ignore prostitution in general, some of which may include sex trafficking. Women and girls are sold into forced marriages; in some cases, their new \ufb01husbands\ufb02 force them into prostitution in Iran or Afghanistan. In other cases, including some organized by extra-judicial courts, girls are used as chattel to settle debts or disputes. Non-state militant groups kidnap children, buy them from destitute parents, or coerce parents with threats or fraudulent promises into giving their children away; these armed groups force children to spy and fight in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Pakistan's large number of IDPs, due to natural disasters and domestic military operations, are vulnerable to trafficking.Pakistani men and women migrate voluntarily to the Gulf states and Europe for low-skilled employment\u0160such as domestic service, driving, and construction work; some become victims of labor trafficking. False job offers and high recruitment fees charged by illegal labor agents or sub-agents of licensed Pakistani overseas employment promoters entrap Pakistanis into sex trafficking and bonded labor. Some Pakistani children and adults with disabilities are forced to beg in Iran. Pakistan is a destination country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor\u0160particularly from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka. Women and girls from Afghanistan, China, Russia, Nepal, Iran, Bangladesh, Uzbekistan, and Azerbaijan are reportedly subjected to sex trafficking in Pakistan. Refugees from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Burma, including Rohinyga, as well as religious and ethnic minorities such as Christians and Hazaras, are particularly vulnerable to trafficking in Pakistan."},"Philippines":{"April":61.0,"Asylum Seekers":"8","August":145.0,"December":55.0,"February":57.0,"Friday":158.0,"Global Population":106651.39,"January":60.0,"July":81.0,"June":112.0,"Life Expectancy":71.1,"March":89.0,"May":99.0,"Monday":136.0,"November":77.0,"October":69.0,"Population below $1.90 a day":"6.1","Saturday":119.0,"September":70.0,"Sunday":98.0,"Thursday":150.0,"Tuesday":139.0,"Violence against civilians":975,"Wednesday":175.0,"fatalities":["1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","5","1","2","1","1","1","1","2","1","2","2","1","1","0","1","1","1","1","2","0","0","1","2","1","1","2","1","1","2","1","1","0","1","1","2","2","0","1","1","1","0","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","2","1","0","1","1","1","3","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","3","2","2","2","0","1","1","1","1","1","2","2","1","0","1","1","1","1","1","2","0","1","1","1","1","0","1","1","1","1","1","3","3","1","1","1","3","1","2","1","1","1","0","1","1","1","1","1","1","3","2","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","2","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","0","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","2","1","1","2","1","9","1","1","1","2","1","2","3","0","1","3","1","1","4","1","0","1","2","1","1","0","1","1","1","1","1","0","1","1","1","1","2","0","1","1","5","6","3","1","1","1","1","1","2","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","3","1","1","1","2","2","1","0","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","0","0","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","0","3","1","1","1","2","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","2","3","1","1","1","1","1","1","2","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","2","1","1","1","1","1","2","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","2","2","2","1","1","1","2","2","1","1","2","1","1","2","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","2","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","2","1","2","1","2","1","2","1","0","1","1","1","1","1","1","0","1","1","2","1","1","2","1","0","2","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","3","3","1","1","1","1","1","1","3","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","2","1","1","2","1","1","1","1","1","2","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","2","1","2","1","2","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","2","2","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","2","1","3","1","3","1","0","1","1","1","1","1","1","2","3","1","1","0","4","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","2","1","1","0","1","2","1","2","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","2","1","1","2","1","1","1","1","0","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","2","1","1","1","0","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","0","1","1","1","1","3","1","1","1","4","1","1","2","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","0","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","2","1","1","1","0","3","1","3","1","1","2","1","1","2","1","1","2","3","1","1","1","1","2","2","0","1","1","0","1","1","1","1","2","1","2","2","1","2","1","1","3","1","1","1","1","1","1","2","1","1","1","1","0","0","4","1","1","1","1","1","8","2","4","1","2","1","1","1","2","1","1","1","1","2","1","1","2","1","0","1","1","1","1","1","2","2","1","1","2","1","1","1","0","0","0","1","0","1","1","1","2","4","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","0","1","1","2","1","1","1","3","1","1","1","2","1","1","2","1","1","1","1","1","2","1","1","1","2","3","1","1","1","1","1","5","1","2","1","1","2","1","1","1","1","3","1","2","1","1","1","1","0","3","2","1","1","1","1","2","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","2","1","0","2","1","1","1","1","2","1","0","0","3","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","3","1","1","0","1","1","2","1","1","1","4","1","2","1","1","1","1","0","0","1","1","1","0","0","1","0","2","4","1","1","1","1","1","1","2","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","2","1","1","1","1","1","0","1","2","1","2","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","2","1","2","1","1","1","1","1","2","2","2","1","1","1","1","2","0","2","1","1","1","3","1","1","1","1","2","1","4","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","0","1","0","1","1","0","2","1","1","1","2","1","1","1","1","0","0","1","1","1","1","1","0","2","1","1","1","2","2","1","1","2","3","1","0","1","1","1","1","2","1","1","1","3","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","2","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","2","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","2","1","1","2"],"government_effort":"NA","introduction":"The Government of the Philippines fully meets the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking. The government continued to demonstrate serious and sustained efforts during the reporting period; therefore the Philippines remained on Tier 1. The government demonstrated serious and sustained efforts by convicting and punishing more traffickers; effectively coordinating identification, referral, and provision of services to more victims; increasing efforts to prevent trafficking of Filipino migrant workers and to assist those who become victims of trafficking overseas; and implementing procedures to reduce the backlog of trafficking cases in the courts. Although the government meets the minimum standards, it did not improve the availability and quality of protection and assistance services for trafficking victims, particularly specialized shelter care, mental health services, access to employment training and job placement, and services for male victims. Further, the government did not vigorously investigate and prosecute officials allegedly involved in trafficking crimes or punish labor traffickers.RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE PHILIPPINESIncrease the availability of specialized shelter and mental health services for victims of trafficking, including child victims of online sexual exploitation and male victims; increase efforts to investigate, prosecute, and convict perpetrators of trafficking, particularly complicit officials and labor traffickers; increase resources for anti-trafficking task forces to support coordinated operations, protection services, and timely preliminary investigation and prosecution of trafficking, including in cases involving online sexual exploitation of children; increase efforts to identify and assist child labor trafficking victims; expand the number of victim and witness coordinators to assist anti-trafficking task forces and increase efforts to prevent re-traumatization caused by multiple interviews; expand government support for follow-up services for trafficking victims that facilitate reintegration, including increased access to job training and employment; develop and implement programs aimed at reducing the demand for commercial sex acts, including child sex tourism and online child sexual exploitation; increase efforts to protect children demobilized from armed groups; and implement improved and consistent data collection across agencies.PROSECUTIONThe government maintained law enforcement efforts. The 2003 and 2012 anti-trafficking acts criminalized sex and labor trafficking and prescribed penalties of six years to life imprisonment and fines of up to 5 million pesos ($100,300). These penalties were sufficiently stringent and, with respect to sex trafficking, commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. During the reporting period, authorities investigated 488 suspected trafficking cases, compared with 553 in 2016. These actions led to the arrest of 283 suspects, an increase from 272 in 2016. During the reporting period, the government initiated prosecution of 177 alleged traffickers (441 in 2016) and convicted 65 traffickers (55 traffickers in 2016). One trafficker was convicted of labor trafficking, compared to no labor trafficking convictions in 2016. Sentences imposed ranged from 12 years to life imprisonment, with most offenders sentenced to life imprisonment. The government filed no criminal cases to punish the recruitment and use of child soldiers by armed groups operating in areas affected by intensified violence.During the year, the supreme court issued revised guidelines for continuous trial of criminal cases to streamline the litigation process; however, endemic inefficiencies and, in some cases, corruption, left nearly 1,200 trafficking cases pending in the judicial system. The government's use of plea agreements in the conviction of 19 traffickers in seven trafficking cases involving online sexual exploitation of children reduced the potential for re-traumatization of child victims who served as witnesses as well as the litigation time; however, the government did not implement measures to reduce the re-traumatization of victims throughout all investigations and prosecutions. While the government increased funding for equipment and facilities for the Philippine National Police Women and Children's Protection Center from 23 million pesos ($461,390) in 2017 to 106 million pesos ($2.1 million) in 2018, support for anti-trafficking task forces declined as the number of prosecutors assigned to the task forces decreased from 240 in 2016 to 203 in 2017. In addition, a lack of equipment and resources for logistics limited the capacity of trafficking task forces to conduct enforcement operations. With support from foreign law enforcement, NGOs, and international organizations, the government conducted more operations to remove child victims of online sexual exploitation from exploitative situations and convicted more perpetrators of this crime. These cases continued to present challenges including difficulty in obtaining timely search warrants, inadequate prosecutorial resources dedicated to preliminary investigations, logistics, and computer evidence analysis, as well as the limited amount of case law pertaining to this form of human trafficking. Late in the reporting period, the Interagency Council Against Trafficking (IACAT) released new guidelines on data collection and monitoring for its member agencies, but inconsistencies in data collected by agencies and a lack of case-specific information continued to impede analysis of enforcement and protection efforts. With donor support, the IACAT also introduced and pilot tested a case management system for prosecutors working with 16 anti-trafficking task forces to facilitate monitoring of prosecutions. To facilitate 351PHILIPPINESevidence collection in online child sexual exploitation and child pornography cases, a second municipality enacted an ordinance requiring money transfer outlets to preserve customer information and transaction data and to provide it to authorities investigating such cases. The government sustained its efforts to provide anti-trafficking training to its officials by supporting the provision of basic and advanced skills training through 238 programs that included a focus on the investigation and prosecution of cases involving forced labor, child soldiers, child victims of online sexual exploitation, as well as the provision of trauma-informed care in residential facilities. The IACAT and regional anti-trafficking task forces conducted 61 anti-trafficking training programs and the IACAT member agencies provided in-kind support for 177 donor-funded training programs that trained a total of 6,400 local, regional, and national government officials, including law enforcers, prosecutors, judges, and social service personnel in 2017. Philippine officials continued to cooperate with other governments to pursue international law enforcement action against suspected foreign traffickers in six cases.The government did not convict any officials for complicity in trafficking despite continued reports of corruption at all levels of government during the reporting period and officials investigating several cases. The government reported initiating administrative investigations of six Bureau of Immigration (BI) employees for immigration act violations, such as permitting at least 24 female domestic workers to depart for the Middle East with tourist visas, and a government official for irregularly issuing an overseas employment certificate to a female hired by the official to work as a personal employee overseas. In addition, the government initiated an investigation of two BI employees for trafficking a female victim in the Middle East. The government did not provide information on the trafficking prosecution of two police officers and a Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) official whose cases were pending in 2017. PROTECTIONThe government increased protection efforts. Through law enforcement activities, the government identified 1,839 potential victims of trafficking, of whom 1,422 were females and 410 were children. The Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) reported serving 1,659 possible trafficking victims, of whom 1,139 were female, compared with 1,713 victims in 2016. DSWD reported assisting 516 victims of sex trafficking, 646 victims of labor trafficking, and 298 victims of illegal recruitment, compared with 465 victims of sex trafficking, 232 victims of labor trafficking, and 530 victims of illegal recruitment the prior year. Through its recovery and reintegration program for trafficked persons, DSWD provided psycho-social support, medical services, legal assistance, livelihood assistance, skills training, and reintegration services to identified victims and led implementation of the national referral system. The government allocated 24.8 million pesos ($497,500), an increase of approximately 1.8 million pesos ($36,110), to implement this program. DSWD also continued to operate 44 residential care facilities that provided services to victims of trafficking and other forms of exploitation. Of these facilities, 24 served children, 12 served women, and one served both women and men. No DSWD shelter is designated solely for the specialized care of trafficking victims. The government provided 419 victims with temporary shelter in a DSWD residential care facility, an NGO facility, or in a local government shelter. The government also provided an unknown amount of support for two NGO-operated halfway houses at border entry points and a facility in the national capital region that serves as a safe space and processing center where law enforcement officials, working with DSWD, interviewed suspected victims immediately after they were removed from a trafficking situation during an enforcement operation. Department of Labor and Employment Relations (DOLE) removed 58 children from hazardous or exploitative working situations, including one child domestic servant, and referred some of these families for livelihood assistance. Available shelter and other assistance services such as mental health services, community reintegration, job training, and access to employment remained inadequate to address the specific needs of trafficking victims, including child victims of online sexual exploitation and male victims. The government increased its resources and provided robust services for Filipino victims abroad. The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), in coordination with DSWD social welfare attaches and DOLE labor attaches deployed in Philippine embassies, assisted 1,476 potential Filipino trafficking victims in the Middle East, Asia, and Europe. The government maintained a temporary shelter for male Filipino victims in Saudi Arabia and migrant resource centers in three other countries where the government admitted 1,097 Filipinos, of whom 1,019 were lured illegally for work in the United Arab Emirates. DFA increased its allocation for the Assistance to Nationals (ATN) Fund from 400 million pesos ($8 million) to 1 billion pesos ($20.1 million) and its Legal Assistance Fund (LAF) from 100 million pesos ($2 million) to 200 million pesos ($4 million). In 2017, DFA disbursed 22.7 million pesos ($455,380) from its ATN Fund, which covered airfare, meal allowance, medical care, and other needs of nearly 15,000 trafficking victims; this represented an increase of more than 21 million pesos ($421,270). In 2017, DFA revised its LAF guidelines to establish priority funding for legal assistance to trafficking victims and it expended 92 percent of its budget by the end of the year. Through its hotline, the Commission of Filipinos Overseas (CFO) assisted 61 possible victims utilizing 5.3 million pesos ($106,320) allocated by the IACAT. The Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (PEOA) reported identifying 140 adult trafficking victims, all but two of whom were victims of domestic servitude, but did not report information about services provided to these victims. The government continued to implement formal procedures to identify trafficking victims in the Philippines and overseas and to refer them to official agencies or NGO facilities for care. As a result, DSWD social workers and representatives of the Overseas Workers Welfare Authority, working in coordination with anti-trafficking task forces, assisted 2,149 repatriated and 15 deported Filipino workers. During the reporting period, the government supported victims who served as witnesses during trials by providing assistance, security, and transportation. Continuing a donor-supported pilot program, two Department of Justice (DOJ) victim-witness coordinators assisted victims whose cases were investigated and prosecuted by anti-trafficking task forces. The IACAT operations center reported assisting 81 witnesses, 51 of whom were minors. Under its witness protection program, justice officials protected 74 victims from reprisals by providing security, immunity from criminal prosecution, housing, livelihood and travel expenses, medical benefits, education, and vocational placement. Judicial officials awarded damages to victims in amounts ranging from 100,000 pesos ($2,010) to 500,000 pesos ($10,030); however, victims were often unable to navigate the complex legal process required to obtain the restitution from convicted traffickers. NGOs confirmed government officials did not punish victims for unlawful acts committed as a result of being subjected to trafficking. Adult victims residing in shelters were permitted 352PHILIPPINESto leave unchaperoned, provided there were no threats to their personal security or psychological care issues. While the government did not identify foreign victims in the Philippines during the reporting period, it had long-term alternatives to deportation of victims to countries where victims may face hardship or retribution.In the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, where an estimated 420,000 persons were displaced during the reporting period due to intensified violence and reports of recruitment and use of child soldiers by armed groups continued, the government declared martial law on May 23, 2017, and extended it into 2018. There were reports soldiers of the Armed Forces of the Philippines detained and interrogated children, and in one instance tortured a child, suspected of associating with armed groups; however, the government did not provide information regarding efforts to investigate these allegations or efforts to provide services or reintegrate children subjected to soldiering. PREVENTIONThe government increased its efforts to prevent trafficking. The IACAT, which was chaired by the secretaries of DOJ and DSWD and included the heads of the key anti-trafficking agencies and three NGO members, met three times during the year and approved 13 resolutions setting policy and approving interagency protocols, including approval of the government's third strategic action plan against human trafficking (2017\u01522021), as well as the national systems for referral, case management, and data collection. In addition, 24 anti-trafficking regional and municipal task forces met regularly during the reporting period to share information and coordinate interagency activities. The IACAT's budget increased from 93.88 million pesos ($1.88 million) in 2016 to 95.28 million pesos ($1.91 million) in 2017. The IACAT and its member agencies led national and regional trafficking awareness raising events. The CFO continued its national prevention campaign and reached approximately 8,000 persons. The POEA conducted 29 seminars for 3,400 law enforcement and other officials on how to detect illegal recruitment and amplified these efforts by training 2,825 officials and NGO partners to provide such training locally. During the reporting period, 722,132 individuals completed pre-employment seminars that provided information about worker protection, legal recruitment, and government services available to overseas foreign workers. Recognizing the increased vulnerability of people living in conftict-affected areas of Mindanao, DOLE and local government officials conducted orientation and trafficking awareness campaigns attended by 820 university students, community leaders, and local officials.POEA developed a database of persons known to be involved in trafficking or illegal recruitment and delisted recruitment agencies for use by the relevant enforcement agencies. National Bureau of Investigation and POEA officials investigated 309 cases of alleged illegal recruitment in 2017, and eight cases resulted in a conviction, compared with 356 investigations and four convictions in 2016. The POEA filed 2,014 administrative charges against licensed agencies for fraudulent employment or exorbitant fees, resulting in the cancellation of 33 agencies' licenses. The BI Travel Control and Enforcement Unit continued to screen departing passengers and deferred the departure of 29,357 passengers due to incomplete or missing travel documents or misrepresentation, referred 104 potential cases of suspected trafficking to IACAT task forces for further investigation, and identified 55 possible victims of illegal recruitment. Despite stopping 168 foreign registered sex offenders from entering the country, local and foreign demand for the country's vast commercial sex trade remained high and the government's efforts to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts were negligible. During 2017, the government signed a regional anti-trafficking convention, led the drafting of its plan of action, and entered into a partnership with another government aimed at addressing child trafficking. The DFA also reviewed 30 bilateral labor agreements with other countries and signed five agreements aimed at reducing the vulnerability of Filipinos working overseas. The government also banned the issuance of new contracts for work in Kuwait following reports of the alleged murder of a Filipina domestic worker there and provided air transport for Filipino workers who wished to return to the Philippines. The government provided anti-trafficking training to Philippine troops prior to their deployment abroad on international peacekeeping missions. The DFA provided training on trafficking and guidelines on the employment of personal staff for its diplomatic personnel.TRAFFICKING PROFILEAs reported over the past five years, the Philippines is a source country and, to a lesser extent, a destination and transit country for men, women, and children subjected to sex trafficking and forced labor. An estimated 10 million Filipinos reside or work abroad and the government processes approximately 2.3 million new or renewed contracts for Filipinos to work overseas each year. A significant number of these migrant workers are subjected to sex and labor trafficking\u0160predominantly via debt bondage\u0160in the fishing, shipping, construction, education, home health care, and agricultural industries, as well as in domestic work, janitorial service, and other hospitality-related jobs, particularly in the Middle East and Asia, but also in all other regions. Traffickers, typically in partnership with local networks and facilitators, engage in illegal recruitment practices that leave migrant workers vulnerable to trafficking, such as charging excessive fees, producing fraudulent travel and contract documents, and confiscating identity documents. Illegal recruiters use student, intern, exchange program, and tourist visas, as well as travel through other countries to circumvent the Philippine government and destination countries' legal frameworks for foreign workers. Traffickers also recruit Filipinos already working overseas through fraudulent offers of employment in another country. Forced labor and sex trafficking of men, women, and children within the country remains a significant problem. Women and children from indigenous communities and remote areas of the Philippines are the most vulnerable to sex trafficking, and some are vulnerable to domestic servitude and other forms of forced labor. Men are subjected to forced labor and debt bondage in the agricultural, fishing, and maritime industries. Persons displaced due to the conftict in Mindanao, Filipinos returning from bordering countries without documents, and internally displaced persons in typhoon-affected communities are vulnerable to domestic servitude, forced begging, forced labor in small factories, and sex trafficking in Metro Manila, Metro Cebu, central and northern Luzon, and urban areas in Mindanao. Sex trafficking also occurs in tourist destinations, such as Boracay, Angeles City, Olongapo, Puerto Galera, and Surigao, where there is a high demand for commercial sex acts. Although the availability of child sex trafficking victims in commercial establishments declined in some urban areas, child sex trafficking remains a pervasive problem, typically abetted by taxi drivers who have knowledge of clandestine locations. In addition, young Filipino girls and boys are increasingly induced to perform sex acts for live internet broadcast to paying foreigners in other countries; this typically occurs in private 353POLANDresidences or small internet cafes, and may be facilitated by victims' family members and neighbors. NGOs report high numbers of child sex tourists in the Philippines, many of whom are citizens of Australia, Japan, the United States, Canada, and countries in Europe; Filipino men also purchase commercial sex acts from child trafficking victims. Organized crime syndicates allegedly transport sex trafficking victims from China through the Philippines en route to other countries. The UN reports armed groups operating in the Philippines, including the New People's Army, Maute Group, the Moro National Liberation Front, the Abu Sayyaf Group, and the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters recruit and use children, at times through force, for combat and noncombat roles; the Islamic State is reported to subject women and girls to sexual slavery.Officials, including those in diplomatic missions, law enforcement agencies, and other government entities, allegedly have been complicit in trafficking or allowed traffickers to operate with impunity. Some corrupt officials, particularly those working in immigration, allegedly accept bribes to facilitate illegal departures for overseas workers, reduce trafficking charges, or overlook illegal labor recruiters. Reports in previous years asserted police conduct indiscriminate or fake raids on commercial sex establishments to extort money from managers, clients, and victims. Some personnel working at Philippine embassies reportedly withhold back wages procured for their domestic workers, subject them to domestic servitude, or coerce sexual acts in exchange for government

However, the government did not meet the minimum standards in several key areas. Lack of sufficient government funding to NGOs for assistance and protection services remained a problem, leaving most victims unprotected, susceptible to re-traumatization, without services, and vulnerable to re-trafficking. Bureaucratic procedures continued to impede victims' access to medical care.

The government developed a draft national action plan for 2018-2022; the last action plan expired in 2016. The national anti-trafficking agency made operational a three-year EU internal security fund grant of \u2022160,000 ($192,080) for prevention campaigns focusing on sexual exploitation in 2018 and forced begging in 2019. In collaboration with an NGO, the agency developed and deployed an online prevention tool for a job and commerce website, warning potential job seekers of possible trafficking risks before they view job offers and providing contact information for the authorities in case of suspicious activity. The agency also organized a number of anti-trafficking awareness campaigns. The agency continued to publish yearly reports and statistics on trafficking. Despite a 2006 amendment to the criminal code that prohibited Romania-based recruitment companies from facilitating the exploitation of citizens abroad, the government did not have the power to punish recruitment agencies for trafficking-related crimes, such as illegal recruitment fees. Observers noted police were unresponsive to reports of labor trafficking and labor inspectors lacked the competency for detecting trafficking as well as the legal authority for unannounced worksite inspections. The government continued to operate a hotline during regular business hours that primarily focused on informing Romanians about working abroad safely. The government took steps to reduce demand for commercial sex acts and forced labor. The government provided anti-trafficking training for its troops prior to their deployment abroad as part of international peacekeeping missions.362RUSSIA","prosecution":"The government decreased overall law enforcement efforts. Articles 210, 211, and 367 of the penal code criminalized sex and labor trafficking and prescribed penalties of three to 10 years imprisonment, which were sufficiently stringent and, with respect to sex trafficking, commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. Authorities opened 675 new trafficking cases in 2017, a decrease from 864 and 858 in 2016 and 2015, respectively. A split reporting structure hindered police efficiency and coordination with investigations and prosecutions. Likewise, limited dedicated financial investigators impeded financial investigations and asset seizures, inhibiting evidence collection in trafficking cases and causing investigators and prosecutors to rely mainly on witness testimony. Prosecutors processed 481 alleged trafficking cases in 2017, compared to 552 in 2016; of these cases, 57 (12 percent) were prosecuted for pandering, rape, sexual activity with minors, and fraud, compared to 416 (75 percent) in 2016, indicating a significant increase in the use of the trafficking statute versus lesser crimes that carried weaker penalties. Prosecutors indicted 362 suspected traffickers in 2017, compared with 358 in 2016 and 480 in 2015. Courts convicted 222 traffickers in 2017, a decrease from 472 in 2016 and 331 in 2015. Fifty-five traffickers (25 percent) received suspended sentences, compared to 22 percent in 2016; the remaining traffickers received sentences of imprisonment, which ranged from one to more than 10 years. The government did not report how many fines were levied on convicted traffickers in 2017, compared with approximately 200,000 lei ($51,550) in 2016. Authorities participated in 43 joint investigative teams with several European counterparts, compared with 21 in 2016. Authorities extradited 44 traffickers to other European countries to serve sentences. The government did not report any investigations, prosecutions, or convictions of government employees complicit in trafficking offenses. The National Institute for Magistrates organized two conferences on strengthening legal knowledge and cooperation with prosecutors and judges to protect victims' rights during judicial 361ROMANIAproceedings; 93 judges, prosecutors, lawyers, and psychologists participated. Prosecutors received training on investigating and prosecuting trafficking cases. The government provided training to government employees on the early identification of victims. The police organized a series of training programs for its staff that included an anti-trafficking component. Regardless of the numerous training events, NGOs reported many police officers and judges lacked specialized training and sensitivity toward sex trafficking cases and trafficking issues. Judges typically did not differentiate between prostitution and sex trafficking as distinct crimes, which had detrimental effects on sentencing for perpetrators and compensation for victims. Observers frequently criticized police for being unaware of the exploitation potential in prostitution, leading to a failure to check for indicators of force, fraud, or coercion when encountering individuals in prostitution. ","protection":"The government maintained efforts in victim protection. Public officials and NGOs identified 662 victims in 2017, the lowest number identified in over a decade and a decline from 757 identified victims in 2016 and 880 in 2015; these statistics included victims from ongoing investigations and prosecutions initiated in previous years. Of these victims, 51 percent were children, 76 percent were female, and 69 percent were subjected to sex trafficking. Police used the government's national victim identification and referral mechanism, although observers reported the government did not proactively identify victims. In 2017, 46 percent (307) of registered victims received assistance provided by public institutions and NGOs, compared with 41 percent in 2016. While the government relied on NGOs to assist victims, it did not provide sufficient financial support. The government did not allocate grants directly to NGOs due to legislation precluding direct funding for NGOs, and it declined to allow its national anti-trafficking agency to become an implementing agency for European funding programs, a status that would have allowed them to allot European funds to NGOs. Additionally, for the second consecutive year, the government failed to channel a Swiss-funded grant (approximately $2 million with the Romanian government co-financing 15 percent) to NGOs for victim assistance efforts. However, the government facilitated the transfer of the Swiss funds to IOM in order to disburse the funds to NGOs.The government maintained five government-run shelters and one shelter jointly run by the government and an NGO that were designated for trafficking victims; these shelters also housed domestic violence victims in separate living areas. Officials referred victims to government-run domestic violence or homeless shelters or privately run shelters when the six trafficking shelters were full. Authorities placed child trafficking victims in general child facilities or in facilities for children with disabilities run by the governmental child protection service, which generally did not offer specialized assistance and frequently re-traumatized children. Perennial problems of abuse and neglect of institutionalized children and the lack of proactive identification in government facilities left children in placement centers and orphanages vulnerable to trafficking. Romanian victims abroad received free travel documents issued by Romanian embassies; the government, NGOs, or an international organization paid for transport costs. Local governments financed and operated transit centers that could assist repatriated victims. The law entitled all victims to legal aid, reintegration support, and psychological and medical care. However, the government did not necessarily provide for more than one mental health counseling session and did not finance medical care costs. NGOs paid for all psychological services costs for victims due to the government's refusal to reimburse psychologists who assisted victims, and for emergency medical care costs because the government lacked financial assistance and medical care required payment upfront. Moreover, access to medical care required Romanian victims to return to their home districts to obtain identity documents. The process presented logistical and financial hurdles for many trafficking victims; NGOs also covered those costs. The law permitted foreign victims to request asylum and granted asylum-seekers the right to work after three months. In 2017, an NGO identified one foreign victim from Pakistan among refugees and asylum-seekers, but suspected dozens of other cases. The law also permitted foreign victims who cooperated with authorities to receive a renewable, six-month temporary residence permit. In 2017, 496 victims participating in criminal proceedings accessed services available to victims assisting law enforcement; these services included transporting victims to court and returning them home. Some victims chose not to testify because the justice ministry published the names of all trial witnesses, including children, on its public website, putting victim-witnesses at risk of retaliation and societal or familial ostracization. While the law allowed victims to provide testimony from a separate room, this was rarely done in practice due to judges' preference for live testimony in front of traffickers. The law entitled victims to restitution from their traffickers; however, victims generally could not afford the fees necessary to initiate civil trials or, in cases in which judges ordered restitution, to pay court officers to collect the money owed from traffickers. Additionally, NGOs reported victims rarely received restitution money because when ordered by courts to pay restitution, traffickers did not do so. Prosecutors typically dropped charges and fines against victims for crimes committed as a direct result of being subject to human trafficking.","recommendation":"Significantly increase efforts to investigate, prosecute, and convict traffickers, including complicit officials, and issue sentences that are proportionate with the severity of the crime; proactively identify potential victims, especially among vulnerable populations, such as migrants and asylum-seekers, children in government placement centers, children involved in begging, and individuals in prostitution, through enhanced training for police officers and labor inspectors on recognizing indicators of exploitation; provide financial support to NGOs for victim services and develop and institute a formal mechanism for administering the funds; amend legislation to allow authorities to sanction recruiting agencies for trafficking-related crimes; increase the quality of psychological counseling and improve access to medical assistance for victims; exempt all trafficking victims who testify in trials from the online disclosure of their names to protect participating witnesses from retaliation and stigma and to incentivize greater victim participation in prosecutions; expand efforts to train officials involved in judicial proceedings, particularly judges, on sensitivity to trafficking issues, understanding all forms of trafficking, and applying anti-trafficking laws; significantly increase anti-trafficking training for law enforcement officials on working with victims, evidence collection, and understanding psychological coercion; increase the number of financial investigators specializing in trafficking cases; finalize, adopt, and implement the 2018-2022 national action plan; and revise the restitution mechanism to include minimizing court fees and increasing efforts to ensure victims receive compensation.","tier":"TIER 2","traffick_profile":"As reported over the past five years, Romania is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and women and children subjected to sex trafficking.

Romanian women and children are victims of sex trafficking in Romania and other European countries. Romani children, as young as 12 years old, are particularly vulnerable to forced begging and sex trafficking. Reports indicate some children were subjected to trafficking while in the care of the state, particularly in small towns. Romania is a destination country for a limited number of foreign trafficking victims, including trafficking victims from Pakistan and the Philippines.

Rwandan police are believed to have killed a Burundian national and thrown his body into the Kanyaru river. The refugee was apparently refusing to enter the Burundian refugee camp.","prevention":"The government maintained efforts to prevent trafficking. The government reestablished the interagency anti-trafficking working group. International organizations and NGOs reported that insufficient coordination among government agencies and resource constraints continued to hinder the government's anti-trafficking efforts. The government continued to implement its 2014-2017 NAP; an international organization worked with the interagency anti-trafficking working group to initiate development of an updated NAP. Throughout the reporting period, the government continued to conduct multiple national and local awareness raising anti-trafficking campaigns in schools and at community events, as well as on television and radio. These campaigns focused primarily on transnational trafficking and did not adequately address internal trafficking. RNP continued to operate a national GBV hotline, which was staffed by social workers trained to identify and refer trafficking cases, which reportedly identified an unspecified number of victims in 2017. The government had policies to regulate labor recruitment companies, which required their registration with the Rwandan Development Board, licensing from the Ministry of Labor, and submission of monthly reports to the government. The government reportedly prosecuted fraudulent companies in the past; however, there were no reports of prosecutions during the reporting period. The government made efforts to reduce demand for forced labor and commercial sex through awareness raising campaigns. The government continued to train labor inspectors on identifying and handling child labor cases, including forced child labor. The government provided training to all Rwandan troops on gender sensitivity, human rights, and trafficking prior to their deployment abroad as part of international peacekeeping missions. ","prosecution":"The government increased law enforcement efforts to combat cross-border trafficking crimes but continued to make inadequate efforts to address internal trafficking crimes. Rwanda's penal code did not criminalize all forms of sex and labor trafficking because it required movement to constitute a trafficking offense. Chapter 8 prescribed penalties of seven to 10 years imprisonment and a fine of 5 million to 10 million Rwandan francs ($5,850 to $11,700) for internal trafficking, and 10 to 15 years imprisonment and a fine of 10 million to 20 million Rwandan francs ($11,700 to $23,400) for transnational trafficking. Child trafficking convictions were subject to a minimum five-year prison term. These penalties were sufficiently stringent and, with respect to sex trafficking, commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. During the reporting period, parliament passed a revised penal code and, following partnership with a foreign donor to draft the provisions, a standalone anti-trafficking law, the Law on the Prevention, Suppression, and Punishment of Trafficking-in-Persons and Exploitation of Others. However, as the president had not yet signed the legislation into law, it remained pending enactment at the close of the reporting period. The National Public Prosecution Authority (NPPA) reported increased efforts compared to the government's previously reported timeframe, initiating 65 trafficking investigations and prosecuting at least 25 alleged traffickers in 25 cases of suspected trafficking between October 2016 and September 2017\u0160a timeframe that does not entirely correspond to the one previously used (July 2015-October 2016). Of the 25 prosecutions of alleged traffickers, five involved internal trafficking. The NPPA reported obtaining convictions for at least 12 traffickers in 12 cases during the specified timeframe, but it did not report the sentences or the laws under which these offenders were convicted. During the previous timeframe, the government reported investigating 44 cases, prosecuting 16 cases, and convicting seven traffickers. In 2017, the government did not adequately prosecute and did not convict any perpetrators of internal sex trafficking or forced labor, despite the presence of trafficking within the country. The government admitted difficulty prosecuting and convicting trafficking offenders due to a lack of investigative and prosecutorial anti-trafficking knowledge, extensive trafficking networks, and lack of victim testimony. Unlike previous years, the government held a complicit official accountable for trafficking offenses, sentencing a former Rwandan National Police (RNP) officer to five years imprisonment for participating in the trafficking of women to Oman. During the reporting period, there were no reports that government officials were complicit in trafficking from refugee camps; however, there were reports that refugee whistleblowers from 2015 experienced reprisal from the government for reporting protection concerns in camps. Following previous years' concerns with complicit officials at the refugee camps, an NGO, in partnership with the government, trained all Ministry of Refugee Affairs and Disaster Management (MIDIMAR) officials on anti-trafficking. As in the previous reporting period, the RNP continued to operate a 15-officer anti-trafficking unit in its Criminal Investigations Division. The RNP directorate for anti-gender-based violence (GBV) had three officers in each of the country's 78 police stations who served as points of contact for domestic trafficking victims. The government continued to provide anti-trafficking training as a part of standard training and professional development for immigration officers, police, labor inspectors, judicial officials, and social workers. The RNP continued to convene quarterly meetings of provincial and district police, investigators, prosecutors, and immigration officials to provide ongoing training on Rwanda's regional anti-trafficking laws, trafficking recognition and investigation techniques, which reached an additional 39 investigators. The government did not report provision of training to law enforcement personnel on a victim-centered approach and victim-witness support mechanisms. The government also held joint exercises with Ugandan and Tanzanian officials for the purpose of bolstering cross-border security, including cooperation to combat trafficking.","protection":"The government modestly increased protection efforts, but proactive victim identification efforts remained inadequate. Law enforcement and immigration officials identified approximately 56 transnational trafficking victims and four internal trafficking victims in 2017; officials referred all 60 victims for assistance at one-stop centers. The government also identified four potential victims who were intercepted en route to Uganda. This compared to 60 transnational victims identified and assisted in 2016. However, the government did not report efforts to identify or assist internal trafficking victims during the reporting period. Law enforcement and immigration officials and social workers in victim centers had victim identification guidelines; however, implementation appeared limited and officials still noted difficulty in screening specifically for trafficking victims among the broader population of victims of GBV assisted at the centers. The government did not adequately collaborate with civil society to identify and assist trafficking victims and did not provide protection services specifically catered to the needs of trafficking victims as distinct from victims of other crimes. The government did not adequately protect vulnerable populations from punishment for crimes committed as a result of being subjected to trafficking. Following 2015 NGO reports of abuse at government transit centers, including Gikondo in Kigali, the government adopted guidelines for improving conditions at the centers. However, the government reportedly continued to detain vulnerable persons, including persons in prostitution, destitute individuals, and street children, and advocacy groups continued to report that the transit centers operated without judicial oversight and functioned as de facto detention facilities in which individuals were not adequately screened for trafficking and were held for arbitrary periods of time. The government expanded its network of Isange One-Stop Centers to assist GBV and trafficking victims from 29 to 44 centers. The government's one-stop centers, located in hospitals 366RWANDAand district capitals, provided short-term care and various psycho-social, medical, legal, and law enforcement services to victims. One-stop centers typically have \ufb01safe rooms\ufb02 available that victims may use as temporary shelter for a few days. The government acknowledged that the extent and quality of services varied between locations, particularly regarding the provision of adequate psycho-social counseling, and that trafficking victims were not always screened and identified as distinct from GBV victims. NGOs highlighted gaps in communication between investigators in rural areas and police at one-stop centers, which may have impeded investigation and prosecution of crimes. The government provided long-term assistance to a limited number of victims on an ad hoc basis; in one case, the government provided a house to a female victim pregnant as a result of being trafficked and consequently rejected by her family. In 2017, the government assisted approximately 10 children, a decrease from the previous year, in a rehabilitation center for former child combatants associated with armed groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), which provided psycho-social support, education, and reintegration services. However, in general, the government lacked long-term care facilities for the vast majority of trafficking victims. The NPPA continued to operate two safe houses for witnesses in criminal cases, which could include trafficking victims; however, for the fourth consecutive year, the government did not report whether the safe houses were used specifically for trafficking victims. The government reportedly encouraged victims to testify against perpetrators, but officials noted that participation of victims in the investigation and prosecution of traffickers continued to be a challenge. An NGO reported that seven of the one-stop centers are equipped with video recording equipment to help encourage the cooperation of witnesses in prosecutions via recorded testimony. Rwandan law does not provide foreign trafficking victims with legal alternatives to their removal to a country where they may face hardship or retribution; however, in practice, the government made efforts not to deport foreign victims who faced retribution in their home country. ","recommendation":"Systematically and proactively identify trafficking victims among vulnerable populations, and ensure potential and identified victims are not arrested, detained, or punished for 365RWANDAunlawful acts committed as a direct result of being subjected to human trafficking; cooperate and coordinate with NGOs and international organizations to provide all foreign and domestic trafficking victims with appropriate long-term protection services, including shelter and psycho-social care; develop and implement a victim-witness support program and expand training for prosecutors dealing with victim-witnesses; develop a formal mechanism to systematically refer trafficking victims to appropriate care; adopt and implement an updated national anti-trafficking action plan (NAP); continue to investigate, prosecute, and convict perpetrators of forced labor and sex trafficking, including internal trafficking; continue to implement protection measures for Rwanda's refugee population; increase training of law enforcement, judicial officials, labor inspectors, and social workers on the implementation of trafficking laws and victim identification procedures; and expand anti-trafficking awareness campaigns.","tier":"TIER 2","traffick_profile":"As reported over the past five years, Rwanda is a source, transit, and to a lesser extent, destination country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking. Rwandan girls and some boys, some of whom are secondary school students between the ages of 13 to 18, are exploited in commercial sex in hotels, at times with the cooperation of hotel owners. Local human rights groups reported in 2017 that some Rwandan girls in domestic work who were terminated by their employers after becoming pregnant, and were therefore unable to return to their home villages, were subsequently exploited in prostitution. Some Rwandan men, women, and children are subjected to sex trafficking and forced labor in domestic work and agricultural and industrial sectors in destinations around the world; the primary destinations for Rwandan victims are Uganda, the DRC, and other parts of East Africa. Rwandan victims are also reportedly exploited in domestic servitude in the Middle East and sex trafficking in China. In 2016, some Rwandan girls were forced into marriages with men in Tanzania and may have experienced commercial sexual exploitation through these marriages. Reporting in 2013 indicated that Kampala- and Nairobi-based labor recruiters and brokers recruited Rwandan workers through fraudulent offers of employment abroad and subjected them to sex trafficking and forced labor in agriculture and domestic work, and the government indicated that foreign-based labor recruiters continued to pose a risk to vulnerable Rwandans during the reporting period. Refugees fteeing conftict and political violence in Burundi and the DRC remain highly vulnerable to trafficking in Rwanda or are subjected to exploitation in third countries after transiting Rwanda. According to an international organization, there has been an increase in sex trafficking of Burundian male and female teenagers through Rwanda to third countries since 2015. In 2015, Burundian refugee girls transited through Rwanda and were exploited in sex trafficking in Uganda; some of these girls may also be subjected to domestic servitude in Uganda. Separately, female child refugees in a Congolese refugee camp in Rwanda were reportedly subjected to sex trafficking in nearby towns in 2015, allegedly facilitated by one civilian and three Rwandan Defense Forces soldiers assigned to the camp. Between May and September 2015, Burundian refugees residing in Mahama refugee camp in Rwanda were recruited into non-state armed groups supporting the Burundian opposition; Rwandan security forces charged to protect the camp population reportedly facilitated or tolerated the recruitment activity. Whistleblower refugees in 2015 alleged that recruiters\u0160including both Rwandan officials and other refugees\u0160threatened, intimidated, harassed, and physically assaulted those who refused recruitment attempts. Most recruits were adult males, but in three verified cases in 2015, Burundian refugee children were also identified as recruits from Mahama refugee camp. Refugees reported that Rwandan military personnel trained Burundian recruits, including women and children, in weaponry at a training camp in southwestern Rwanda. There were no reports of forcible or coerced recruitment out of Mahama refugee camp by Rwandan government officials in 2017.367ST.

The government-funded and commenced implementation of its four-year national action plan and continued to improve shelter services through a privatization program. It also prosecuted four Saudi nationals for passport retention. However, the government did not demonstrate increasing efforts compared to the previous reporting period. It continued to arrest andor deport undocumented migrant workers, some of whom were potentially unidentified trafficking victims. The government prosecuted and convicted fewer traffickers and did not explicitly report the penalties imposed or other sentencing details it administered. Because the government has devoted sufficient resources to a written plan, that, if implemented, would constitute significant efforts to meet the minimum standards, Saudi Arabia was granted a waiver per the Trafficking Victims Protection Act from an otherwise required downgrade to Tier 3.

The Saudi Arabian government reiterated its commitment to combat human trafficking through initiatives undertaken as part of the Vision 2030 socioeconomic reform program. The government allocated a budget of 36 million SAR ($9.6 million) for its interagency anti-trafficking secretariat, which commenced implementation of its 2017-2020 national action plan to combat trafficking that focused on monitoring, prevention, building government capacity, inter-ministerial coordination, effective law enforcement, and provision of protective services for victims. The government-controlled media frequently aired discussions of forced labor, visa scams, forced begging, and other trafficking-related topics throughout the reporting period to raise awareness among the Saudi public. Officials operated a 24-hour call center that received calls in nine major labor-sending country languages including Urdu, Hindi, Bengali, Tagalog, Indonesian, Malay, and Amharic, in addition to Arabic and English. During the reporting period, the call center received approximately 1.3 million general inquiries and requests, labor disputes, employment complaints, and tips, which helped authorities identify four trafficking cases. MOLSD continued to receive workplace-related grievances via its website, a smartphone application, and social media. Expanding on a 2016 pilot program that provided pre-paid SIM cards to domestic workers and laborers arriving at Riyadh's international airport, the government launched this initiative in Jeddah and Dammam in 2018 to educate workers on their rights through complementary calls and text messages to the call center and local embassies.In February 2018, the government implemented a new phase of the WPS, requiring employers to pay foreign workers by electronic transfer via a Saudi bank, thereby permitting the MOLSD to track disbursements. This requirement applied to all employees who worked for companies with 11 or more employees and covered the vast majority of expatriate workers in Saudi Arabia. In addition, it mandated individual employers of domestic labor to issue prepaid payroll or salary cards as soon as the domestic worker arrived in the Kingdom to ensure a legal working relationship between employer and employee and safeguard employees' prescribed wages. During the reporting period, the WPS covered a total of 6.4 million workers; more than 95 percent of Saudi companies were compliant with the system requirements, and the five percent in noncompliance were penalized, including an unknown number whose services the government suspended, either temporarily or permanently. The government made efforts to reduce the demand for commercial sex and forced labor. MOLSD conducted investigations of 17 cases of passport retention and imposed upon each defendant 1,000 SAR ($270) per passport withheld without consent; during the previous reporting period the government did not report investigating any such crimes that contained trafficking indicators. In addition, the prosecutor general investigated four Saudi business owners who retained their workers' passports without their employees' consent and referred all four to the judiciary; authorities fined each Saudi employer 2,000 SAR ($530) in accordance with the ministerial decree. The government did not report investigating or referring for criminal prosecution any passport retention crimes during the previous reporting period. MOLSD continued to employ nearly 1,000 labor inspectors, and during the reporting period, it ordered the closure of 14 recruitment offices and the suspension of operations of 40 others that contravened Saudi Arabia's labor laws. There were anecdotal accounts of employers prosecuted for these violations. Additionally, MOLSD imposed fines on 227 work places violating the government's mid-day work ban during the summer months. During the reporting period, the government concluded bilateral labor agreements with the governments of Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia, and the Philippines, which aimed to protect workers' contracts with their employers. There were no reported cases of Saudis prosecuted or convicted for sex tourism outside the Kingdom. The government provided anti-trafficking training for its diplomatic personnel. ","prosecution":"The government increased its law enforcement efforts but demonstrated an uneven ability to capture and share data on trafficking-related cases. The 2009 anti-trafficking law criminalized labor and sex trafficking and prescribed punishments of up to 15 years imprisonment and financial penalties of up to 1 million Saudi Arabian riyal (SAR) ($266,670), which were increased under aggravating circumstances, including trafficking committed by an organized criminal group or against a woman, child, or person with disabilities. These penalties were sufficiently stringent and, with respect to sex trafficking, commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. The Council of Ministers' Decision 166 prohibited withholding workers' passports as a lesser criminal offense punishable by fines.During the reporting period, the government reported investigating and prosecuting 177 trafficking cases, as compared to 264 in 2016. Of these, it convicted 20 traffickers under the anti-trafficking law and, due to insufficient information to prosecute as trafficking crimes, acquitted 31 defendants; 133 cases remained pending in the court system at the close of the reporting period. In 2016, the government achieved 254 prosecutions and convictions; however, this higher number was due to an amalgamation of trafficking and trafficking-related crimes, in addition to multiple laws under which they were criminally pursued. The 2017 convictions were for forced and bonded labor, involuntary domestic servitude, and forced begging. The government did not explicitly report the specific penalties imposed on the convicted traffickers or how many received prison sentences, although it reportedly handed down severe sentences to each convicted trafficker to include lengthy imprisonment, fines, and confiscation of gains from the trafficking crimes. The government did not report any investigations, prosecutions, or convictions of government officials complicit in human trafficking offenses. In December 2017, the Human Rights Commission (HRC) sponsored a train-the-trainer workshop provided by an international organization on general trafficking issues for 171 officials, including 42 judges and representatives of the Ministry of Labor and Social Development (MOLSD), border guard and police personnel, the interior ministry, recruitment companies, and foreign embassies. The HRC also developed and produced multiple anti-trafficking public awareness campaigns that also reached an unknown number of government officials. ","protection":"The government maintained efforts to protect trafficking victims and reported details on its protection efforts for the first time. The government widely disseminated victim identification and referral criteria to relevant official stakeholders and provided regular training on their implementation. During the reporting period, officials identified and referred to government-run shelters 121 trafficking victims\u0160of which 20 were victims of forced labor\u0160out of 164 individuals proactively identified as potential victims; during the previous year, it did not provide aggregate information on victims identified, but reported 264 potential victims discovered over the course of investigations. The government allocated\u0160and reported for the first time\u016010 million SAR ($2.7 million) to the MOLSD, which operated shelters across the country for vulnerable populations and abuse victims, some of whom were likely trafficking victims. These include shelters for child beggars in Mecca, Jeddah, Dammam, Medina, Qassim, and Abha, in addition to welfare centers for female domestic workers in at least ten locations throughout the Kingdom and for male domestic workers in Riyadh. Each shelter provided accommodation, social services, health care, psychological counseling, education, and legal assistance, and all 121 government-identified victims received these services from the government during the reporting period; the government did not report what types of protection services, if any, it provided to identified victims during the previous reporting period. Diplomats from labor-sending countries had regular access to their nationals residing in government-run shelters and reported conditions and quality of services in the shelters varied slightly across the Kingdom, but were overall satisfactory and safe. Some embassies and consulates\u0160including those of the Philippines, India, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka\u0160also operated shelters for their respective nationals. Various diplomatic missions reported complaints by their citizens of unpaid wages, passport retention, physical or sexual abuse, or substandard working conditions. The Saudi Arabian government and foreign missions reported the large majority of foreign workers in Saudi Arabia did not experience problems with their employers. During the reporting period, officials extended a 90-day amnesty program, which commenced in March 2017, for five additional months for undocumented migrant workers, those who worked for an unofficial sponsor, and those who were declared absconders by employers, to depart the Kingdom without punishment by granting emergency exit certificates. The amnesty program also permitted undocumented expatriates to reverse their illegal status, fully exempt from any associated consequences. After the expiration of the amnesty period, the government detained approximately 250,000 people reportedly in violation of its residency laws and deported some 50,000, the majority of whom were of Ethiopian descent, according to press reports. There were no reports of confirmed trafficking victims being punished for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of their being subjected to trafficking; however, despite efforts to improve screening there were claims by human rights organizations that the government did not always screen all deportees for potential trafficking victimization and police frequently arrested andor deported undocumented migrant workers, some of whom experienced abuses indicative of forced labor and were potentially unidentified trafficking victims. The government extended all identified trafficking victims the option of remaining in the country\u0160either in a shelter or via transfer to a new employer\u0160during judicial proceedings or an immediate exit visa; these benefits did not require a successful prosecution or cooperation with law enforcement personnel. Victims who wanted to repatriate immediately could assign a power-of-attorney and pursue their legal case from abroad. During the reporting period, the anti-trafficking secretariat worked with interior ministry officials to extend the residency permits\u0160without employers' consent\u0160of an unknown number of identified trafficking victims on an ad hoc basis. The government reportedly encouraged victims to assist in the investigation and prosecution of trafficking offenders, and the law entitled trafficking victims to legal 371SAUDI ARABIAassistance, security protection, translation services, and the right to immediate repatriation or continued residence in-country until resolution of the case, in addition to medical and psychological care, shelter, and recovery; it did not report how many victims accessed these provisions during the reporting year. The government reportedly provided protection to witnesses involved in trafficking cases, but the government did not report any cases in 2017. Officials permitted victims to obtain restitution from the government and file civil suits against trafficking offenders; however, such restitution generally occurred outside of civil court proceedings, and the government typically and informally reimbursed workers for back wages andor assisted in their repatriation. ","recommendation":"Strengthen efforts to prosecute, convict, and stringently sentence trafficking offenders, including abusive employers, under the anti-trafficking law; reform the sponsorship system and ensure trafficking victims are able to pursue criminal cases against their employers in practice; vigorously investigate for potential trafficking crimes employers who withhold workers' passports and wages and restrict workers' movement, and adequately punish these employers under the anti-trafficking law; continue to improve efforts to ensure victims among 370SAUDI ARABIAvulnerable populations, including domestic workers, illegal foreign migrants, male victims, and persons in prostitution, are not punished for acts committed as a direct result of being subjected to human trafficking to include proactive screening for trafficking indicators when arresting and before deporting individuals among vulnerable populations; continue to expand the formal victim identification mechanism to proactively identify trafficking victims among vulnerable populations; continue to train government officials on identifying cases of sex trafficking; and, expand country-wide public awareness campaigns on all forms of trafficking.","tier":"TIER 2","traffick_profile":"As reported over the past five years, Saudi Arabia is a destination country for men and women subjected to forced labor and, to a lesser extent, forced prostitution. Men and women\u0160primarily from South and Southeast Asia and Africa\u0160voluntarily migrate to Saudi Arabia to work in a variety of sectors, including construction and domestic service, and some are low-skilled laborers; many of these workers are vulnerable to forced labor. Some migrants are illegally recruited to work in Saudi Arabia and subsequently forced into domestic servitude and debt bondage. The Kingdom's migrant laborer population continued to be the largest group at risk of human trafficking, particularly female domestic workers due to their isolation inside private residences and subjection to severe employer abuse. According to a regional news source, there are approximately 11 million foreign workers in Saudi Arabia, and the largest populations during the reporting period hailed from India, Pakistan, Egypt, Indonesia, Syria, Yemen, Bangladesh, the Palestinian Territories, Sudan, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka. In previous years, some foreign citizens who have experienced indicators of trafficking were prosecuted for crimes and sentenced to death. Non-payment of wages is the prominent complaint from foreign workers in the Kingdom, while employers withholding workers' passports remains a significant problem. Trafficking perpetrators include businesses of all sizes, private families, recruitment companies in both Saudi Arabia and labor-sending countries, gangs, and organized criminal elements. Due to Saudi Arabia's requirement under its de facto sponsorship\u0160kafala\u0160system that foreign workers obtain permission from their employers for an exit visa to be able to legally depart the country, some are forced to work well beyond their contract term because their employers do not grant such permission. Although most migrant workers sign contracts delineating their rights, some report work conditions substantially different from those previously prescribed, while others never see work contracts at all, rendering them vulnerable to forced labor and debt bondage. Additionally, some migrant workers voluntarily enter into illegal arrangements where they seek freelance work while concurrently paying a Saudi national to sponsor their initial residency permit, thereby becoming vulnerable to extortion by their sponsors. Some migrants from Yemen and the Horn of Africa who enter Saudi Arabia 372SENEGALillegally\u0160involuntarily or through smuggling\u0160via the Yemeni border may be trafficking victims. Previous reports allege some Saudi citizens engaged in sex tourism abroad, where they engaged in temporary or seasonal marriages, which included payment for short-term sexual access to children and others who the purchaser then abandons.

The government demonstrated significant efforts during the reporting period by convicting five traffickers, including one for forced begging; collecting data from more regions; training officials on the 2005 anti-trafficking law; restarting a lapsed campaign to remove children from the streets; and finalizing and committing to fund a 2018-2020 anti-trafficking national action plan. However, the government did not demonstrate overall increasing efforts compared to the previous reporting period. Police rarely investigated suspected trafficking cases brought to their attention, especially forced begging cases, which effectively prevented such cases from moving forward in the law enforcement system. In some cases, officials obstructed justice by pressuring the judiciary to drop cases against allegedly exploitative Quranic school teachers (marabouts). In addition, the only trafficker convicted for forced begging received a fine, which was inconsistent with the penalties prescribed in the 2005 law, and victim services remained inadequate. Because the government has devoted sufficient resources to a written plan that, if implemented, would constitute significant efforts to meet the minimum standards, Senegal was granted a waiver per the Trafficking Victims Protection Act from an otherwise required downgrade to Tier 3. Therefore Senegal remained on Tier 2 Watch List for the third consecutive year.

A source in Ziguinchor said that \"thirteen were killed and two were able to escape\".","prevention":"The government increased efforts to prevent human trafficking. The CNLTP continued to implement the 2015-2017 anti-trafficking national action plan. The government allocated 80 million FCFA ($142,270) to the CNLTP in 2017, a significant increase from 50 million FCFA ($88,920) allocated in 2016. With wide input from a variety of civil society and religious leaders, the government developed and adopted a 2018-2020 anti-trafficking national action plan, and it committed to funding the CNLTP for implementation of the plan. While funding for the CNLTP increased, it remained insufficient, and the CNLTP had to seek additional donor funds to support many of its activities. In collaboration with NGOs, the CNLTP continued awareness-raising programs on child forced begging and sex trafficking. The Ginddi Center continued to run a hotline for child trafficking in three languages. The hotline received 3,409 calls during the reporting period, leading to the identification of 1,077 vulnerable children, many of whom were trafficking victims. Staff responded to each call, despite the fact that the Ginddi Center did not have a vehicle, forcing it to rent one each time it followed up on a trafficking report. Due to limited funding, the hotline only operated from 7:30am-10:00pm. In 2016, the government allocated 100 million FCFA ($177,830) to the then-Ministry of Women, Families, and Childhood to implement the president's June 2016 campaign to remove children from the streets of Dakar, including child trafficking victims. The ministry used some of that funding to assist families vulnerable to trafficking and daaras who committed to ending the practice of forcing children to beg. The MGGCP continued to provide in-kind support during the reporting period to vulnerable families and daaras that did not engage in forced begging. The government ceased all other activities under the 2016 campaign for the majority of the reporting period because the funding ran out. At the close of the reporting period, the MGGCP began the second phase of the campaign with increased roles for the Ministries of Interior, Justice, and Health, as well as local officials. The second phase began to address earlier 374SERBIAcomplaints about a lack of government coordination during the first phase of the campaign. While the lack of interagency coordination on trafficking among government structures remained a problem, reports indicated the MGGCP's efforts began to improve coordination during the reporting period. For example, MOI officials and MGGCP social workers conducted joint operations to identify and remove child trafficking victims from situations of exploitation.Four local governments partnered with an international donor to provide funding and in-kind support to local communities in order to close daaras that practiced forced begging, repatriate child forced beggars to their homes, and decrease the incidence of forced begging; the local governments reported a drastic decrease in the incidence of forced begging in their communities as a result of this effort. To better understand the scope of child forced begging around the country, the MGGCP, with the support of a foreign NGO, continued the daara mapping project. Government and religious leaders finalized the draft decree to operationalize the draft bill to modernize daaras; if passed, the bill would outline requirements that daaras must meet in order to be eligible for government subsidies. The bill and operational decree remained in draft form at the end of the reporting period. According to the law's drafters, daaras that used forced begging would not be eligible to receive subsidies; participation in the program would be voluntary, however, so it was unclear if the draft bill, once passed, would adequately address child forced begging. Approximately 60 percent of Senegal's economy operated in the informal sector, where most forced child labor occurred, yet the government did not improve regulation of this sector or provide adequate protections for workers. The government made efforts to reduce the demand for forced labor and commercial sex acts. The task force's tourism police forces continued to monitor the resort areas of Saly and Cap Skirring for indicators of child sex tourism and other abuses, although they did not report identifying any cases of child sex trafficking. The government, in cooperation with international partners, provided anti-trafficking training to Senegalese troops before their deployment abroad as part of international peacekeeping missions. ","prosecution":"The government maintained minimal anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts. Senegal's 2005 Law to Combat Trafficking in Persons and Related Practices and to Protect Victims criminalized labor and sex trafficking. The law prescribed penalties of five to 10 years imprisonment and a fine for sex trafficking and labor trafficking\u0160except forced begging\u0160and prescribed lesser penalties of two to five years imprisonment and a fine for forced begging. These penalties were sufficiently stringent and, with regards to sex trafficking, commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. In data collected from five of Senegal's 14 regions, the government reported investigating 20 cases of alleged trafficking, prosecuting 10 alleged traffickers, and convicting five, compared to 16 investigations, eight prosecutions, and five convictions the previous reporting period, with data from three regions. At least four investigations involved sex trafficking and seven involved forced labor; the type of trafficking in the other investigations was unknown. Nine investigations and five prosecutions were ongoing at the end of the reporting period. Four traffickers\u0160one adult sex trafficker and three child sex traffickers\u0160received two years imprisonment. One trafficker received a fine for forced begging. Officials rarely used the 2005 anti-trafficking law to prosecute alleged traffickers, and all sentences imposed during the reporting period were below the minimum penalties prescribed in the law. Despite allegations of government complicity\u0160either by refusing to investigate trafficking offenses or pressuring the judiciary to drop cases\u0160the government did not report any investigations, prosecutions, or convictions of government officials complicit in human trafficking offenses. Authorities from the then-Ministry of Women, Families, and Childhood and the government-run Ginddi Center for trafficking victims noted in mid-2017 that they routinely reported individuals suspected of involvement in forced child begging to the gendarmerie criminal research brigade. To date, however, there has not been a single investigation or prosecution in response to the referrals. Most trafficking prosecutions and convictions have focused on sex trafficking; the government has only convicted three individuals for forced begging under the 2005 law in the last five years, which is inadequate compared to the scale of the problem. In addition, judiciary and social services officials reported that some government officials, including within the Ministry of Interior (MOI), have used their positions and inftuence to prevent law enforcement and the judiciary from pursuing cases against individuals who force children to beg.As in past years, the anti-trafficking task force (CNLTP) co-financed five trainings led by international organizations on identifying, investigating, and prosecuting human trafficking. These trainings reached more than 200 judges, prosecutors, and police officers, as compared to reaching 124 officials the previous year. In addition, the Ministry of Justice conducted several training sessions for law enforcement and judiciary officials on the 2005 law, investigation practices, and the national trafficking database. However, many law enforcement and judicial personnel remained unaware of the provisions of the 2005 law, which, coupled with limited institutional capacity, inhibited efforts to prosecute and convict traffickers under the law and collect data on such efforts. Although the government began to roll out a national trafficking database 373SENEGALin key regions of the country and trained law enforcement on its usage, the government did not fully implement it during the reporting period. ","protection":"The government maintained efforts to identify and provide services to trafficking victims. Law enforcement, immigration, and social services personnel had formal written procedures to proactively identify trafficking victims among high-risk populations; however, they made limited efforts to implement those procedures, especially among gold-mining communities and children in begging. The government, at times in collaboration with NGOs, identified and referred to services approximately 1,381 trafficking victims during the reporting period\u0160including three Nigerian sex trafficking victims and a significant number of child forced begging victims. This was compared to identifying and providing services to 1,547 potential child trafficking victims the previous reporting period, when the government led a campaign to identify children in forced begging. One NGO repatriated and reunited 249 of the trafficking victims with their families, with the government providing travel documents for foreign victims and transportation for internal returns. A second NGO identified and cared for an additional 565 trafficking victims without government support. The government created a new ministry with a special emphasis on child protection\u0160the Ministry of Good Governance and Child Protection (MGGCP). The MGGCP took the lead for child trafficking victim protection. The Ginddi Center, under the aegis of the MGGCP, provided temporary shelter and basic care to both foreign and domestic victims. The Ginddi Center cared for approximately 1,278 victims during the reporting period, and authorities referred at least 20 other trafficking victims to NGOs for care. Nearly all victims identified were child forced begging victims from Senegal, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, The Gambia, and Mali. In a positive step, authorities stopped their previous practice of returning child forced begging victims to exploitative marabouts. However, Ginddi Center officials reported that even when victims were returned to their families, recidivism occurred. The government provided 90.6 million West African CFA francs (FCFA) ($161,120) to the center in 2017, an increase from 85.7 million FCFA ($152,400) allocated to the center in the previous year. The center provided basic meals and shelter for victims. The center could also provide clothing, basic psychological services, and legal counseling, but only when such resources were available; it was unknown how many victims received these services during the reporting period. The center lacked sufficient staff, resources, and specialized training for social workers and volunteers, and it only had one volunteer doctor to provide basic medical treatment. The center lacked space to accommodate all victims identified, which limited the number of victims authorities could remove from exploitation and how long victims could remain at the center. In order to address the lack of space at the Ginddi Center, in March 2018 the MGGCP began sending some trafficking victims identified during the second phase of the anti-forced begging campaign to the center for immediate services, and then on to partner daaras\u0160which the government had certified met capacity, hygiene, and security standards and did not engage in forced begging\u0160that provided children with follow-on support until family reunification. Seventy-five trafficking victims identified in late March 2018 were sent to one such daara. The Ministry of Justice operated three shelters (CPAs) for child victims of crime, witnesses, and children in emergency situations, which trafficking victims could access. It was unclear how much funding the CPAs received in 2017, but the government allocated 20 million FCFA ($35,570) to the centers in early 2018. Several NGOs operated trafficking victim shelters throughout the country. Outside of Dakar, international observers reported NGOs sometimes had to provide critical shelter and trafficking victim services due to a lack of government involvement. Authorities inconsistently applied the victim referral system, and it was not available in all regions of the country. Authorities referred victims identified along Senegal's borders to an international organization and government center for questioning before referring them to NGOs or government centers for protective services. In Dakar and rural areas, law enforcement, civil society, and community protection groups generally referred children to the government or NGOs for social services and repatriation; however, members were not always aware of the shelters and services available, especially for adults, which at times caused delays in the provision of services. The law provided alternatives to the removal of foreign victims who may face hardship or retribution upon return, including the option to apply for temporary or permanent residency; the government did not report offering this relief to any victims during the reporting period. Victims could legally obtain restitution and file civil suits against their traffickers, although the government did not report that any did so during the reporting period. ","recommendation":"Explicitly direct law enforcement and encourage judicial officials to significantly increase efforts to investigate and prosecute trafficking offenses brought to their attention and convict and punish traffickers, including those who exploit children in forced begging, with sufficiently stringent sentences; ensure prosecutors and investigative judges operate in full independence and pursue forced begging cases without interference or consequences; establish a legal framework to regulate daaras (Quranic schools) and allocate adequate inspectors to enforce implementation; implement the 2018-2020 anti-trafficking national action plan, including by allocating sufficient funding to the anti-trafficking task force; expand funding or in-kind support to government- and NGO-run shelters to increase care options for victims; train law enforcement, labor, and social welfare officials to adequately identify trafficking victims, including among child beggars, investigate cases, refer victims to services, and prevent their penalization; expand workplace regulations to include labor inspections in the informal sector; continue the daara mapping project; and broaden efforts to raise public awareness of trafficking.","tier":"TIER 2 WATCH LIST","traffick_profile":"As reported over the past five years, Senegal is a source, transit, and destination country for women and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking. Forced begging is the most prevalent form of trafficking; some marabouts and men who claim to be marabouts force children to beg in Dakar and other major cities in Senegal. A 2014 government study reported marabouts or men pretending to be marabouts force approximately 30,000 children to beg in Dakar alone. In addition, a 2017 NGO-led study identified more than 14,800 child forced begging victims in Saint-Louis and reported that 187 of the city's 197 daaras send children to beg for at least part of the day. Traffickers subject Senegalese boys and girls to domestic servitude, forced labor in gold mines, and sex trafficking. Internal trafficking is more prevalent than transnational trafficking, although boys from The Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, and Mali are victims of forced begging in Senegalese cities as well as forced labor in artisanal gold mines in Senegal. Traffickers exploit Senegalese women and girls in domestic servitude in neighboring countries, Europe, and the Middle East, including Egypt. Reports indicate traffickers exploit most Senegalese sex trafficking victims within Senegal, particularly in the southeastern gold-mining region of Kedougou. Traffickers also subject Nigerians, Guineans, Malians, and Burkinabes to forced labor and sex trafficking in mining communities. West African women and girls are subjected to domestic servitude and sex trafficking in Senegal, including for child sex tourism for tourists from France, Belgium, Germany, and other countries.

On July 28, 2018 in Belgrade, Serbia lawyer Dragoslav Ognjanovic was shot. Ognjanovic was known for having represented late Serbian dictator Slobodan Milosevic. His death provoked a lawyer strike with lawyers demanding greater protection from the state. On July 10, 2018 in Bela Crkva, Serbia journalist Stefan Cvetkovic was assaulted with a metal pipe. On April 17, 2018 in Leskovac, Serbia TV Prva journalist team was assaulted, during which a cameraman suffered a head injury. On March 25, 2018 in Novi Pazar, Serbia, a Muslim religious leader was attacked by unknown armed perpetrators, which left him suffering life-threatening injuries. On March 4, 2018 during the local elections for Belgrade City Council in Serbia one of the observers of the CRTA NGO was attacked in the municipality of New Belgrade. On March 4, 2018 during the local elections for Belgrade City Council in Serbia one of the activists of the Serbian Progressive Party was attacked in the municipality of Vozdovac. On February 16, 2018 in Karaburma, Belgrade, two reporters from the \"O2\" and 'Prva televizija' media outlets respectively were assaulted while reporting on a story about illegal migrants found in a private house in that settlement.","prevention":"The government increased prevention efforts. The government adopted the anti-trafficking strategy and action plan for 2017-2022. The government allocated 8 million dinars ($79,950) to implement the action plan for the first two years. The government created a stand-alone Office of the National Coordinator, elevating the national coordinator to a full-time position, and allocated five employees and office space. The government replaced the anti-trafficking council with the Council to Combat Trafficking (CCT) and mandated it to meet twice year; the council met in December 2017. CCT founded an interagency working group to strengthen cooperation and a separate multi-disciplinary group to monitor the implementation of the national strategy. The government organized educational and outreach activities, but efforts were on an ad hoc basis. The government operated a hotline to collect human trafficking-related tips, published anti-trafficking efforts on its website, provided information on trafficking via social media and incorporated trafficking issues into grade school curriculums. Police continued to enforce laws against purchasing commercial sex. The government did not make efforts to reduce demand for forced labor. The government licensed and regulated private employment agencies; however, observers reported in practice, tourist agencies also performed labor recruitment and were largely unregulated. GRETA reported the Market Inspectorate may take up to two months to react to reports of fraudulent employment offers. Serbian troops participated in anti-trafficking training prior to their deployment on international peacekeeping missions.","prosecution":"The government maintained law enforcement efforts. Article 388 of the criminal code criminalized sex and labor trafficking and prescribed penalties ranging from two to 12 years imprisonment, which were sufficiently stringent and, with respect to sex trafficking, commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. Law enforcement investigated 13 suspects (14 in 2016). The government initiated prosecutions against 24 defendants (23 in 2016). The government continued ongoing prosecutions for 14 defendants from previous years. Courts convicted 13 traffickers (22 in 2016 and 20 in 2015). Traffickers received sentences between one year and eight years imprisonment.The government consolidated the jurisdiction to investigate trafficking under the Criminal Police Directorate (CPD); in previous years, the border police and Foreigners Office split this responsibility, which hindered investigations because of unclear jurisdiction and the implication that a trafficking crime needed a transnational element. Observers reported the need to increase the capabilities and capacity of the CPD to investigate trafficking. Each police directorate had both a standalone anti-trafficking unit and officers within the organized crime police and border police that specialized in investigating trafficking. The government also continued to operate a standing migrant smuggling and trafficking task force that coordinated efforts to proactively investigate trafficking. The Public Prosecutor's Office (PPO) designated specialized prosecutors for trafficking cases, who also acted as single points of contact for investigators and care providers and provided operational guidance. Experts reported strengthened cooperation with the PPO but noted prosecutors faced difficulties in distinguishing the differences between labor rights violations and forced labor. The government trained police, immigration officials, border police, and labor inspectors on anti-trafficking issues, including 60 police officers on the structural change for investigative jurisdiction. The government did not report any investigations, prosecutions, or convictions of government officials complicit in human trafficking offenses. ","protection":"The government maintained efforts in victim protection. The government identified 40 trafficking victims (49 in 2016). Of these, 21 were victims of sex trafficking, four of forced labor, four of forced begging, one of forced criminality, and 10 of multiple types of exploitation. Eighteen victims were children (21 in 2016). First responders referred 142 potential victims (150 in 2016) to the government's Center for Protection of Trafficking Victims (CPTV); the government referred 44, social welfare organizations referred 57, and 41 were referred by civil society or other means. Seventeen police directorates also had multi-disciplinary anti-trafficking teams that included prosecutors, social workers, and health officials intended to identify and refer victims in their localities; however, observers reported most teams did not meet and had minimal activities in 2017. The government continued to lack formal victim identification procedures. The Ministry of Labor, Employment, Veteran and Social Affairs implemented the use of trafficking indicators produced by CPTV but the use of these indicators was ad hoc in other government entities, such as law enforcement and schools. Observers reported law enforcement in charge of investigating prostitution-related offenses, particularly outside of Belgrade, continued to operate with limited or no training on victim identification. CPTV trained first responders on proactive identification of victims, including within migrant and refugee populations. The government used an outdated national referral mechanism that lacked established roles and responsibilities for referring victims to support services. CPTV assessed and officially recognized victims referred by first responders and developed a protection and assistance plan for each victim. GRETA reported CPTV lacked the staff to review cases in a timely manner and resources to travel to the location of potential victims and interview them in person. Experts also reported concern about the lack of control and transparency over the official victim assessment. The government did not provide information on funds allocated for victim protection in 2016 or 2017. The government did not provide funding to NGOs despite relying on their victim support and reintegration services. The government and NGOs provided psycho-social, legal, educational, medical, financial, and reintegration support; however, the government had limited procedures outlining cooperation with NGOs on victim services. CPTV had two units, the protection agency and the urgent reception center, but for the fifth consecutive year the urgent reception center, designed to provide safe shelter and services, was not functional. An NGO-run shelter remained the only specialized shelter for female trafficking victims; local centers for social work (LCSW) operated shelters for domestic violence victims that also accommodated female trafficking victims. GRETA visited a LCSW-run shelter in Sremska Mitrovica and reported \ufb01good living conditions\ufb02 but these shelters generally lacked the specialized programs and trained staff necessary for working with trafficking victims. Experts reported CPTV referred fewer victims to NGOs for support and assistance in 2017. The government reported authorities returned child victims to their families, referred them to foster care, or placed them in one of the two Centers for Children without Parental Care; however, observers reported CPTV lacked specific procedures for child trafficking victims. For example, the questionnaire used in the identification process was not adapted to children and children often did not understand the questions. Observers reported there were no child-friendly premises for interviews and the majority of social workers did not receive specific training on working with children. The government did not provide specialized support for male victims; an NGO rented accommodation for male victims as needed and male victims could access all other rehabilitation services offered to female victims. CPTV signed a protocol with the National Employment Service (NES) to assist victims in finding employment; NES assisted 36 victims in 2017. Victims' ability to access support services and assistance was not contingent on cooperating with law enforcement investigations; however, once a case was reported to police, authorities required victims to cooperate with investigations and testify during prosecution, including children. Observers reported Serbian authorities threatened some victims with prosecution for non-cooperation. Authorities did not adequately protect victims' rights during lengthy court proceedings and victims frequently had to appear in front of their traffickers. Observers reported CPTV consistently appointed lawyers to represent victims but the length of trials and assistance provided to victims depended on the individual prosecutor or judge. Judges did not consistently assign the status of \ufb01especially vulnerable witness\ufb02 to trafficking 376SEYCHELLESvictims; this status allowed witnesses to testify without the defendant present and allowed testimony via video link. The government inappropriately prosecuted trafficking victims for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being subjected to human trafficking, particularly forced criminality; however, NGOs reported CPTV successfully intervened to suspend known prosecutions of trafficking victims. The law entitled victims to file criminal and civil suits against their traffickers for restitution, but judges continued to encourage victims to seek restitution solely by filing civil suits. One victim received 2.2 million dinars ($21,710) in compensation from a civil suit in 2017; however, civil suits were lengthy, expensive, and required the victim to face the abuser numerous times. Only two victims received compensation to date. The government provided foreign victims temporary residence permits renewable up to one year; two victims received residence permits in 2017. Observers reported the government provided inadequate repatriation support for Serbian forced labor victims in Slovakia.","recommendation":" Vigorously investigate, prosecute, and convict traffickers and sentence them to stringent penalties; formalize victim identification procedures and ensure their implementation; update the national referral mechanism, including formalizing cooperation with NGOs to provide all victims necessary support services and adopting specific procedures for children; provide victims testifying in court protection to diminish intimidation and re-traumatization; train investigators, prosecutors, and judges on victim-centered approaches to trafficking cases; fully implement written guidance to prevent penalization of trafficking victims for acts committed as a direct result of being subjected to human trafficking and amend the law to mandate non-penalization of victims; increase efforts to identify victims, including among migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers, and unaccompanied children engaged in street begging; allocate sufficient resources to enable the Center for the Protection of Trafficking Victims to implement victim protection efforts and allocate resources for the completion of 375SERBIAthe urgent reception center; improve training for government personnel on victim assistance and referral; and provide labor inspectors and market inspectors the resources and training necessary to regulate recruitment agencies and investigate cases of fraudulent recruitment.","tier":"TIER 2","traffick_profile":"As reported over the past five years, Serbia is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to sex trafficking and forced labor, including domestic servitude and forced begging. Serbian women are subjected to sex trafficking both in Serbia and in neighboring countries and throughout Europe, particularly Austria, Germany, Turkey, and Italy. Serbian nationals, primarily men, are subjected to forced labor in labor-intensive sectors, such as the construction industry, in European countries (including Azerbaijan, Slovenia, and Russia) and the United Arab Emirates. Serbian children, particularly Roma, are subjected within the country to sex trafficking, forced labor, forced begging, and petty crime. Thousands of migrants and refugees from Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and neighboring countries transiting through or stranded in Serbia are vulnerable to trafficking within Serbia.

The government demonstrated significant efforts during the reporting period by investigating trafficking cases and initiating prosecutions, identifying and referring victims to services, and funding temporary shelter and services for 16 Sierra Leonean trafficking victims exploited abroad. However, the government did not demonstrate increasing efforts compared to the previous reporting period. For the seventh consecutive year, the government did not convict a trafficker. Judicial inefficiency, general corruption, and procedural delays continued to prevent traffickers from being held accountable and contributed to judges dismissing many trafficking cases during the reporting period. The government continued to rely on NGOs to provide nearly all victim assistance, and uneven implementation of the national referral mechanism resulted in delayed assistance for some victims. For the fourth consecutive year, the government did not provide funding for the anti-trafficking task force to adequately fulfill its mandate or implement the 2015-2020 national action plan. Therefore Sierra Leone was downgraded to Tier 2 Watch List.","iso3":"SLE","latitude":["9.2885","8.4661","8.4871","8.4871","8.4871","8.4871","7.9918","8.63","8.8833","8.4871","8.4871","8.4871","8.4871","8.4871","7.9647","8.4871","7.9647","8.3383","9.5","8.3102","8.703"],"location":["Madina","Yonibana","Freetown","Freetown","Freetown","Freetown","Daru","Koidu","Makeni","Freetown","Freetown","Freetown","Freetown","Freetown","Bo","Freetown","Bo","Waterloo","Kamaportho","Tokeh","Kono"],"longitude":["-12.673","-12.2137","-13.2356","-13.2356","-13.2356","-13.2356","-10.8427","-10.98","-12.05","-13.2356","-13.2356","-13.2356","-13.2356","-13.2356","-11.7383","-13.2356","-11.7383","-13.0719","-12.2333","-13.1924","-10.915"],"notes":"On September 29, in Tonko Limba Chiefdom (Kambia, Northern), police raided the village and killed a small boy for unknown reasons.

In Kamalo, the entourage of the opposition Sierra Leone People's Party (SLPP) candidate, Mr Julius Maada Bio, came under attack, leading to destruction of vehicles and injuries of his supporters. A well-organised attack on SLPP members and supporters took place in Tokeh on Sunday, 18th February 2018. The Deputy Minister of Trade and Industry, Mr. Ibrahim Washinghai Mansaray took APC thugs to Tokeh before the arrival of the SLPP Presidential Candidate, Julius Maada Bio and many supporters were attacked and arrested. On February 14, in Kono town (Kono, Eastern), a car driven by a known member of the APC drove into a crowd of C4C supporters. The number of injuries was not reported.","prevention":"The government made minimal efforts to prevent trafficking. The anti-trafficking task force had a 2015-2020 national action plan and met regularly, but the government did not provide an operational budget for the task force or funding for implementation of the plan, which limited activities and impeded law enforcement efforts. While MLSS had strict licensing procedures for new recruitment agencies to prevent exploitation of intending migrant workers, it continued to issue business registration certificates before TOCU had finished vetting the prospective agencies. The government did not report any tangible efforts to correct this issue. After continued reports of Sierra Leonean women fraudulently recruited to Kuwait for domestic work and forced prostitution, TOCU and MLSS investigated alleged fraudulent recruitment networks for suspected trafficking, and some of these investigations led to prosecution. MSWGCA and police participated in several radio programs to raise awareness of human rights, including the dangers of human trafficking. The government did not make discernible efforts to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts or forced labor. After identifying Sierra Leonean forced labor victims abroad, Sierra Leonean embassies in Kuwait and Guinea contacted other migrant workers in the country to inform them of the dangers of human trafficking and provide them with information on their rights as workers and assistance available. In addition, the government provided 5 million leones ($650) to some trafficking victims upon repatriation to educate their communities about trafficking. The government did not provide anti-trafficking training to its diplomatic personnel. ","prosecution":"The government maintained minimal anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts. The 2005 anti-trafficking law criminalized sex and labor trafficking and prescribed penalties of up to 10 years imprisonment andor a fine; these penalties were sufficiently stringent. The Sexual Offences Act criminalized forced prostitution and child prostitution with penalties of up to 15 years imprisonment, which were sufficiently stringent and commensurate with penalties for rape. The anti-trafficking task force continued to review the 2005 law with the aim to align the penalties for sex trafficking with the penalties for forced prostitution prescribed in the Sexual Offenses Act.The government reported 33 investigations, prosecution of seven suspects, and no convictions, compared to 34 investigations, prosecution of four suspects, and no convictions in the previous reporting period. All seven prosecutions were ongoing at the close of the reporting period; at least one of the prosecutions had been initiated in a previous reporting period. The government did not report how many investigations remained ongoing at the end of the reporting period, and it did not report how many, if any, investigations it had continued from the previous year. Among the 33 investigations, there were three for sex trafficking and 30 for forced labor. Due to lengthy investigations required for trafficking cases, prosecutors sometimes pursued trafficking cases under charges in the Domestic and Gender Abuse Act or the Child Rights Act because they required less evidentiary rigor and could more often result in conviction. However, the government did not report any data on trafficking cases prosecuted under these acts during the reporting period. The government last convicted an individual for trafficking or trafficking-related offenses in 2011. Judicial inefficiencies, general corruption, and procedural delays prevented traffickers from being held accountable and diminished faith in the judicial system. As a result, victims' families often accepted payments from traffickers rather than pursue cases in court and families sometimes exerted pressure on victims to not participate in investigations and prosecutions against their alleged traffickers due to security concerns, community ties to alleged traffickers, and the high cost and travel required to participate in such cases. In many cases, victims either did not agree to testify against their traffickers and prosecutors dropped the charges, or victims could not meet the travel requirements for court appearances and judges dismissed their cases. In an effort to better prosecute these crimes, the judiciary designated Freetown Court Number One as the dedicated court to hear all human trafficking cases. Inadequate training of law enforcement and judges on human trafficking remained a key problem. The Sierra Leone Police Family Support Units trained 75 police officers from other units on trafficking in persons and human rights issues broadly. In practice, however, the police's Transnational Organized Crime Unit (TOCU) and the Ministry of Labor Social Services (MLSS) investigated most trafficking cases, and neither entity received anti-trafficking training during the reporting period. Two NGOs trained border guards and police on identifying human trafficking. The government did not report any investigations, prosecutions, or convictions of government officials complicit in human trafficking offenses; however, corruption, particularly within the judiciary, remained a serious problem and affected the provision of justice to trafficking victims. Traffickers bribed prosecutors not to prosecute cases and bribed judges to dismiss cases. The government continued regular border security meetings with the Governments of Guinea and Liberia, which included trafficking, but reported its non-ratification of the ECOWAS Convention on Mutual Assistance in the Fight against Trafficking compounded the difficulties in cross-border investigations. ","protection":"The government maintained uneven protection efforts. The government identified 46 trafficking victims in Sierra Leone and abroad, compared to 34 victims identified in the previous reporting period. Among the victims identified, authorities reported males and females, adults and children, and victims of sex trafficking, domestic servitude, and internal labor trafficking. The majority of victims were Sierra Leoneans exploited in labor trafficking in a foreign country. The government relied on NGOs to care for the majority of trafficking victims. The government referred 33 of the 46 victims it identified to NGOs for care. The Ministry of Social Welfare, Gender, and Children's Affairs (MSWGCA) operated a temporary shelter for victims of gender-based violence that trafficking victims could access, and it referred two trafficking victims to the shelter during the reporting period. It was unclear how much funding the shelter received. The government did not report if the other 11 victims identified received government or NGO services; at times, family members provided intra-familial care. In the previous reporting period, the government had committed to devoting approximately 119 million Leones ($15,570) quarterly to an NGO shelter that cared for the majority of trafficking victims; however, it disbursed only one payment of approximately $3,940 to the NGO during the reporting period, and did not provide any other financial support to NGOs that delivered nearly all victim care. NGOs reported identifying and providing services to seven additional victims. One NGO operated a shelter specifically for trafficking victims and offered medical, psycho-social, legal, and reintegration support. The center cared for both foreign and domestic victims; however, staff did not permit victims to leave unchaperoned. Two additional NGOs operated shelters that cared for vulnerable children, including trafficking victims. The government had standard measures to identify trafficking victims, including victims among vulnerable populations. The government had a national mechanism to refer trafficking victims to services; however, a lack of training on the mechanism caused delays in provision of services to victims. In one case, a victim slept at a police station for three weeks because authorities did not request appropriate housing, and in several other cases, MSWGCA officials disregarded the standard protocols for referring victims to NGOs for specialized care. In one case, police intercepted a suspected trafficker and suspected trafficking victims at the border. When alerted to this case, MSWGCA did not follow the established procedures to refer trafficking victims to care, and instead drew up fostering paperwork to allow the children to travel with the alleged trafficker a second time; police intercepted the suspected trafficker a second time and released her after investigation, while an NGO cared for the children. The Sierra Leonean embassy in Kuwait temporarily housed several trafficking victims and referred others to a shelter for care; the government-funded repatriation for five victims, and an international organization repatriated an additional 10 trafficking victims. In addition, the embassy in Guinea housed and provided food, clothing, and repatriation for 11 trafficking victims; however, the government continued to hold the victims' passports at the close of the reporting period. This was comparable to Sierra Leonean embassies supporting and repatriating at least 25 trafficking victims from Kuwait and Guinea the previous reporting period. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs engaged with the Government of Kuwait to advocate for humane treatment of Sierra Leonean domestic workers. The government provided a brochure to migrants returning from Libya with information on social services trafficking victims could access. The government did not provide sufficient protection or support 380SINGAPOREto victims who participated in trials against their traffickers; as a result, many victims could not meet the travel requirements for court appearances and judges dismissed their cases. Two trafficking victims participated in trials against their traffickers during the reporting period. The anti-trafficking law did not provide for restitution, and while victims could file civil suits against their traffickers, none did so during the reporting period. The Sexual Offenses Act provided for restitution, which sex trafficking victims could access; however, restitution could only be pursued after conviction, and there were no convictions during the reporting period. The law provided alternatives to removal to countries in which victims would face retribution or hardship, including temporary residency; the government did not report providing these services to any victims during the reporting period. There were no reports the government detained, fined, or jailed victims for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being subjected to trafficking, but inadequate screening for trafficking may have resulted in some victims remaining unidentified in the law enforcement system. ","recommendation":"Increase efforts to prosecute and convict traffickers with sufficiently stringent sentences that include imprisonment; institute witness protection and support measures to encourage greater victim participation in the criminal justice process; train police, prosecutors and judges to investigate and prosecute trafficking cases, including those at Freetown Court Number One; address procedural delays, including by allowing regional courts to try trafficking cases, and address judicial corruption so victims can participate in trials and judges cease dismissing cases against alleged traffickers; train all actors on the national referral mechanism to ensure trafficking victims receive timely services; increase financial or in-kind support to NGOs that support trafficking victims; follow the licensing procedures for recruitment agencies, and investigate agencies suspected of fraudulent recruitment; improve coordination among government agencies responsible for combating trafficking in persons; train law enforcement officers and social workers to identify trafficking victims among vulnerable populations, including children in sex trafficking and domestic servitude; sufficiently fund anti-trafficking activities in the national budget and allocate funds to the anti-trafficking task force; in collaboration with civil society organizations, increase efforts to raise public awareness of trafficking; amend the 2005 anti-trafficking law to remove sentencing provisions that allow for a fine in lieu of imprisonment; and continue to improve data collection on anti-trafficking law enforcement and victim assistance efforts.379SIERRA LEONE","tier":"TIER 2","traffick_profile":"As reported over the past five years, Sierra Leone is a source and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking. Traffickers recruit victims largely from rural provinces to urban and mining centers for exploitation in sex trafficking and forced labor in domestic service, artisanal diamond and granite mining, petty trading, portering, making ceramics, rock breaking, quarrying, street crime, and begging. Traffickers exploit victims in fishing and agriculture, and sex trafficking or forced labor through customary practices, such as forced marriages. The government reported child sex trafficking\u0160especially of children from poor homes\u0160was a serious problem, including at beaches and in nightclubs. Local demand fueled the majority of child sex trafficking, although foreign tourists were also clients at beaches and nightclubs. Traffickers typically operate individually, convincing parents to hand over their children and promising to provide an education or better life but instead exploiting the children in trafficking. Children from neighboring West African countries have been exploited in forced begging, forced labor, and sex trafficking in Sierra Leone, and Sierra Leonean children are taken to Mali, Niger, and increasingly Guinea for forced labor and sex trafficking. During the reporting period, traffickers exploited Lebanese and Indian men in forced labor in Sierra Leone; in previous years, Chinese, Indian, Kenyan, and Sri Lankan men have been forced labor victims in Sierra Leone. Traffickers have exploited boys and girls from Sierra Leone reportedly as \ufb01cultural dancers\ufb02\u0160and possibly also for sexual exploitation\u0160in The Gambia. During the reporting period, an increasing number of traffickers, including family members, tried to sell Sierra Leonean children for domestic servitude. Sierra Leonean adults voluntarily migrate to other West African countries, including Mauritania and Guinea, as well as to the Middle East and Europe, where some are subjected to forced labor and forced prostitution. Sierra Leonean-Kuwaiti trafficking networks increasingly fraudulently recruit Sierra Leonean for education in Europe and the United States but subject them to domestic servitude in Kuwait. During the reporting period, authorities identified traffickers moving women through Guinea en route to exploitation in Kuwait. Traffickers also exploit Sierra Leonean women in domestic servitude in Egypt and Lebanon. During the reporting period, an international organization repatriated at least 186 Sierra Leoneans from Libya, some of whom were victims of slavery and sex trafficking. It also reported that some Libyan soldiers sold stranded Sierra Leonean migrants in their custody to Libyan and Middle Eastern traffickers."},"Somalia":{"April":39.0,"Asylum Seekers":"58","August":40.0,"December":59.0,"February":45.0,"Friday":71.0,"Global Population":15008.23,"January":47.0,"July":67.0,"June":57.0,"Life Expectancy":57.07,"March":37.0,"May":43.0,"Monday":100.0,"November":61.0,"October":60.0,"Population below $1.90 a day":"NA","Saturday":87.0,"September":55.0,"Sunday":94.0,"Thursday":80.0,"Tuesday":84.0,"Violence against civilians":610,"Wednesday":94.0,"fatalities":["1","0","4","2","2","0","0","1","1","1","1","0","1","0","1","1","1","1","1","1","0","1","0","1","1","1","1","1","0","0","1","1","1","0","1","1","1","1","1","3","1","0","1","1","1","1","0","0","1","1","1","1","3","1","0","1","0","1","2","2","1","1","1","1","0","1","0","1","1","0","0","1","1","1","1","0","1","2","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","1","1","1","1","1","0","0","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","2","0","1","0","4","1","0","0","1","0","1","1","0","1","1","1","1","1","6","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","0","1","1","1","1","1","0","1","1","1","1","0","1","1","1","2","0","2","1","1","3","0","0","1","0","1","0","1","0","0","0","1","1","5","1","1","5","1","1","1","0","0","2","1","0","1","3","1","0","0","0","4","0","0","1","1","1","0","0","0","2","1","1","0","3","2","1","1","0","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","2","0","1","1","0","1","1","0","1","1","1","2","0","1","2","1","1","5","1","0","1","1","0","1","0","1","0","1","1","1","2","2","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","3","4","1","2","1","2","0","1","2","1","0","0","0","1","1","0","4","0","0","2","3","1","1","1","0","1","1","0","0","1","1","0","1","1","1","1","1","0","1","0","1","1","1","1","0","0","1","0","1","1","1","0","0","1","1","1","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","1","1","1","0","1","1","0","3","2","1","0","1","0","1","1","0","1","1","0","1","1","0","0","1","1","1","0","0","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","2","1","1","1","1","2","1","1","1","2","1","1","1","1","0","1","1","5","2","1","1","0","1","1","1","2","0","0","0","1","2","1","1","1","1","0","2","1","1","1","1","1","2","1","6","1","1","1","2","1","2","3","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","2","1","1","1","1","0","1","1","1","1","1","1","0","1","1","1","1","1","1","0","0","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","0","1","1","1","0","1","1","3","1","0","1","1","1","1","1","0","1","0","0","0","0","1","0","1","0","1","1","0","1","0","0","1","0","1","0","1","1","0","1","0","1","1","1","5","2","1","0","1","1","1","2","0","0","3","0","4","1","1","1","1","1","3","1","1","0","0","0","0","1","1","0","1","0","1","1","1","1","1","1","0","0","0","1","1","0","1","1","1","1","1","1","0","1","1","1","1","2","2","1","0","1","1","1","0","2","2","5","5","2","1","1","0","1","2","0","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","0","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","2","1","0","1","1","0","0","1","1","0","0","1","0","0","1","0","1","1","0","0","1","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","2","0","2","1","0","1","5","1","1","0"],"government_effort":"Somaliland and Puntland authorities sustained limited efforts to combat trafficking during the reporting period. Due to the protracted campaign to degrade al-Shabaab and establish law and order in Somalia, law enforcement and judicial officials remained understaffed, undertrained, and lacked capacity to effectively enforce the law. The pre-1991 penal code (applicable at the federal and regional levels) criminalized labor trafficking and some forms of sex trafficking. Article 455 criminalized slavery, prescribing penalties of five to 20 years imprisonment. Article 464 criminalized forced labor, prescribing penalties of six months to five years imprisonment. Article 457 criminalized the transferring, disposing, taking possession or holding of a person, and prescribed penalties of three to 12 years imprisonment. All of these penalties were sufficiently stringent. Article 408(1) criminalized compelled prostitution of a person through violence or threats, prescribing penalties of two to six years imprisonment, which was sufficiently stringent but not commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. The provisional constitution prohibited slavery, servitude, trafficking, and forced labor under Article 14. Article 29(6) under the provisional constitution prohibited the use of children in armed conftict. In September 2017, Somaliland endorsed a draft human trafficking law, designed in consultation with an international organization; although relevant line ministries endorsed the draft law, the Somaliland Parliament had not passed it by the close of the reporting period. In November 2017, Puntland ratified a human trafficking legislative framework after three years of consultations with an international organization. The legal framework was composed of new penal and criminal procedure codes and a law that specifically prohibited trafficking. Authorities in Puntland and Somaliland did not report on law enforcement efforts. In 2017, the Somali Police Force (SPF) under the FGS reportedly investigated one potential trafficking case involving South Sudanese traffickers, but it did not report any prosecutions or convictions; in 2016, SPF police also investigated one potential trafficking case that failed to progress through the judiciary. During the previous reporting period, authorities in Puntland prosecuted 23 child sex trafficking cases, three of which resulted in convictions and five-year prison sentences plus a fine of 1.6 million Somali shillings ($2,780). However, analogous to previous years, no comprehensive statistics existed at either the federal or regional levels on investigations, prosecutions, or convictions of or related to trafficking. Information regarding officials alleged to be complicit in the facilitation of sex and labor trafficking remained largely unknown, and the government did not report efforts to investigate, prosecute, or convict any official for involvement in trafficking or criminal activities  related to trafficking during the reporting period. It failed to take action against military officials for the unlawful recruitment and use of children during the year.The inter-ministerial Trafficking and Smuggling Task Force served as the federal government's anti-trafficking coordinating body, which included representation from the SPF, Ministry of Internal Security, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Justice, and Ministry of Interior and Federal Affairs, and led by the permanent secretary of the Ministry of Interior and Federal Affairs. During the previous reporting period, the task force commenced development of a national action plan on trafficking efforts, but did not report progress on this plan within the current reporting period. The criminal investigations division of the SPF had a 40-officer Counter-Trafficking and Organized Crime Unit, but according to an international organization, this unit has never received counter-trafficking training. The SPF counter-trafficking unit and coast guard officers participated in various trainings on the recognition of trafficking cases separately led by two international organizations during the reporting period. Justice officials from the FGS also participated in a workshop on prosecution and adjudication of trafficking cases also conducted by an international organization. The Puntland state police, in collaboration with an international organization, conducted two follow-up trainings on trafficking investigations for 42 officers during the reporting period. In Puntland, the state-level Counter-Trafficking Board, established in March 2013, was the lead and, during the reporting period, it established a referral mechanism to coordinate trafficking and irregular migration issues and facilitated a provision of direct assistance to trafficking victims, in addition to generating awareness of these issues. The Somaliland government established the Counter Human Trafficking Agency of Somaliland in 2016, which included representatives from immigration, police, coast guard, the attorney general's office, and the ministries of commerce, finance, and civil aviation. The agency was mandated to coordinate counter-trafficking efforts including developing legislation and collecting data, but its work remained limited in reach.No governmental entity had systematic procedures to identify or refer trafficking victims to protective services, and all relied fully on international organizations and NGOs to provide victim assistance, including food, clothing, shelter, legal support, medical aid, counseling, and reintegration services. Statistics for trafficking victims in Somalia were unavailable; however, an international organization reported it received referrals of 21 trafficking victims during the reporting period. In the previous year, Puntland authorities partnered with civil society to provide protective care for 23 trafficking and smuggling victims; it also helped facilitate the return home of 29 child victims. Near the end of the current reporting period, Puntland authorities developed and operationalized a regional referral mechanism for trafficking victims, with support from an international organization. Victim care was inadequate and varied significantly across the country. Beyond the scope of an international organization's migrant response centers, victims had limited access to protective provisions. Specialized care, especially mental health, was unavailable to most victims due to a lack of practitioners. The FGS did not provide financial or in-kind support to organizations assisting victims. In Puntland and Somaliland, authorities provided building sites for migrant response centers in Bosasso and Hargeisa, and in some cases transportation costs to the victims to enable their return home. During the reporting period, the FGS facilitated the repatriation of 24 Somali migrants who wished to return home from Libya, with auxiliary support from the EU. In addition, the FGS, with backing from an international organization, provided medical attention to repatriated citizens, and other federal authorities provided psycho-social support. There were no legal alternatives to the removal of foreign trafficking victims from Somalia to countries where they may face hardship or retribution.Authorities across Somalia demonstrated limited efforts to prevent trafficking during the year. In Puntland state, members of the anti-trafficking board participated in a three-month radio, television, and community social mobilization awareness campaign conducted by an international organization to sensitize the public on human trafficking, including how to detect and report suspected cases of trafficking; members of the Puntland counter-trafficking board participated in some of the talks and presentations during this campaign, but the Puntland state government did not fund the program. Following the initial repatriation ftight of 11 Somali migrants from Libya, the FGS used social and traditional media to cover the repatriations and highlight the risks of trafficking and abuses faced by victims. No government entity provided funding to agencies for labor inspections, and no inspectors were employed to enforce labor laws. Authorities across Somalia did not make any discernible efforts to reduce the demand for forced labor or commercial sex acts. The government did not provide anti-trafficking training for its diplomatic personnel. Somalia is not a party to the 2000 UN TIP Protocol.During the year, there were continued reports of the Somali National Army (SNA) and allied militias, Ahlu Sunna Wal Jama'a (ASWJ) militia, clan militia, and al-Shabaab unlawfully using child soldiers, with the latter committing the large majority of violations. UN officials documented the recruitment and use of more than 2,100 children in 2017. The reported number of children used or recruited by al-Shabaab increased significantly during the reporting period as compared to the previous period, while the reported number of those used and recruited by the SNA, ASWJ, and clan militias decreased. An unspecified number of children were also reportedly used as informants by the National Intelligence and Security Agency. Children identified in SNA units were primarily used for carrying equipment and running errands; however, there were unconfirmed reports of SNA units using children as front-line fighters in Hirshabelle, as well as child soldiers who defected from al-Shabaab and immediately involved in direct hostilities by government-affiliated forces. No children were reported abducted, recruited, or used by peacekeeping forces of the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) during the year. The dire security situation and restrictions on movement precluded detailed child soldier reporting during the year. In 2017, al-Shabaab continued to involve children in conftict through recruitment and participation in direct hostilities, such as planting explosives and carrying out attacks, in addition to support roles such as carrying ammunition, water, and food; removing injured and deceased militants; gathering intelligence; and serving as guards. The terrorist organization also enslaved an indeterminate number of young girls and exploited them in sexual servitude. Al-Shabaab continued to raid schools, madrassas, and mosques for recruitment purposes, and in rural areas of Galmudug state and elsewhere, the terrorists forced students as young as 7 years old to enroll in al-Shabaab-managed madrassas, which included military training and indoctrination in their curricula. The government continued to implement the 2014 action plan to end the recruitment and use of children by the SNA, although efforts to do so remained incomplete. However,  during the reporting period, the SNA's Child Protection Unit (CPU) reported it conducted trainings for SNA officers and enlisted soldiers and expanded awareness outside of Mogadishu and visited SNA and SNA-affiliated units across five sites in Southwest, Hirshabelle, and Galmudug states, as well as two sites in Mogadishu and Banaadir regions. During these visits, the CPU screened approximately 1,500 soldiers and briefed them on the importance of preventing child recruitment into the security forces; of these, it identified 16 children and referred them to the FGS and UN authorities for care. Nonetheless, the UN continued to report concerns about the arrest and detention of some children allegedly associated with al-Shabaab by government forces, particularly in Puntland. Beyond the screening and training trips, the FGS launched a public awareness campaign, with UN support, to promote broad awareness of child protection issues and means of removing children from armed conftict. It also produced advertisements for television and radio stations in south-central Somalia to discourage child recruitment, and it commissioned local artists for a series of counter-recruitment billboards and banners placed around Mogadishu, Puntland, Southwest, Hirshabelle, Galmudug, and Jubaland. Most Somalis lacked birth certificates, and without an established birth registration system or standardized method for recruitment, verifying claims of child soldiering remained difficult.","introduction":"Somalia remains a Special Case for the sixteenth consecutive year. During the reporting period, the Federal Government of Somalia (FGS) controlled its capital city, Mogadishu, and regional governments retained control over most local capitals across the country. The self-declared independent region of Somaliland and the federal member state of Puntland retained control of security and law enforcement in their respective regions. The FGS had limited inftuence outside Mogadishu; the al-Shabaab terrorist group continued to occupy and control rural areas in the Juba River Valley in south-central Somalia, which it used as a base to conduct attacks across the country, and was itself involved in human trafficking. The FGS focused on capacity-building and securing Mogadishu and government facilities from attacks by al-Shabaab. The sustained insurgency by al-Shabaab continued to be the main obstacle to the government's ability to address human trafficking in practice. The government had minimal capacity to address most crimes, including human trafficking, and thereby demonstrated minimal efforts in all regions on prosecution, protection, and prevention of trafficking. Some federal and regional armed forces were not paid regularly, limiting the government's effective control of its territory and its ability to undertake anti-trafficking efforts. Police across Somalia lacked proper investigatory capacity to deal with trafficking cases. Although reportedly improved from previous years, some Somali officials continued to lack an understanding of trafficking crimes, which they often conftated with migrant smuggling.

No reported injuries.","prevention":"NA","prosecution":"NA","protection":"NA","recommendation":"NA","tier":"SPECIAL CASE","traffick_profile":"As reported over the past five years, Somalia is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking. Information regarding trafficking in Somalia remains extremely difficult to obtain or verify. Trafficking routes within the country are particularly opaque, but anecdotally, victims are more likely to be subjected to trafficking from south-central Somalia to the regions of Puntland and Somaliland in the north. In Somaliland, women act as recruiters and intermediaries who transport victims to Puntland, Djibouti, and Ethiopia for the purposes of domestic servitude or sex trafficking. A majority of victims originate in south-central Somalia, with the main destinations being Europe (primarily Italy), Yemen, Gulf States (primarily Saudi Arabia), South Africa, and Kenya. Three cross-border trafficking routes are most commonly used by traffickers: (1) south-central Somalia to Yemen via Puntland; (2) Somalia to Europe via Kenya or Ethiopia and onward to Libya or Egypt; and (3) Somalia to South Africa via Kenya and Tanzania. A fourth route, to Europe via Turkey, is also employed by some traffickers, albeit in smaller numbers due to higher costs. Notwithstanding the unavailability of reliable figures, the FGS notes that, anecdotally, fewer Somalis arrive in their intended destination countries but rather become stranded in transit countries. Al-Shabaab continued to facilitate human trafficking crimes, using deception to recruit victims in south-central Somalia and Kenya and subsequently forcing them into sexual slavery, support roles, and marriages to al-Shabaab militants. During the reporting period, an increasing number of middle-class Somalis and unaccompanied children were subjected to trafficking, though IDP and unemployed youth aged 18-35 remain the most vulnerable. Due to poverty and an inability to provide care for all family members, some Somalis willingly surrender custody of their children to people with whom they share familial ties and clan linkages; some of these children may become victims of forced labor or sex trafficking. While many children work within their own households or family businesses, some children may be forced into labor in agriculture, domestic work, herding livestock, selling or portering khat, crushing stones, or in the construction industry. Driven by pressure to seek employment opportunities, youth and women working in the informal sector remain at high risk of trafficking. In addition, certain marginalized ethnic minorities continue to face greater risk of sex and labor trafficking, as do people living in areas under al-Shabaab control. Although there remains a dearth of reliable statistics, Somaliland and Puntland continued to receive an inftux of economic migrants and refugees from war-torn Yemen and the Oromia region of Ethiopia during the reporting period. Exploitation of and gender-based violence in refugee and IDP camps in Somalia, sometimes perpetrated by gatekeepers in control of the camps, remains a concern, particularly in exchange for food and services for what are otherwise free services; this establishes a cycle of debt and renders these individuals vulnerable to trafficking.According to an international organization, traffickers employ deception as the predominant recruitment method, though al-Shabaab often uses coercion and force. Most trafficking networks are run by a combination of Somali, Djiboutian, Eritrean, and North African traffickers. Somali police reportedly investigated one network run by South Sudanese traffickers during the reporting period. An increasing number of traffickers target and recruit children, without their parents' awareness or support by false promises that no payment will be demanded until they reach their targeted destinations. Traffickers and smugglers reportedly take advantage of the vulnerability of IDP women and children, mostly from southern and central Somalia, at times using false promises of lucrative jobs in Europe and North America. Traffickers transport Somali women, sometimes via Djibouti, to the Middle East, where they frequently endure domestic servitude or forced prostitution. Somali men experience conditions of forced labor as herdsmen and workers in the Gulf States. Traffickers transport children to Saudi Arabia and Djibouti and force them to beg on the streets. Dubious employment agencies facilitate human trafficking by targeting individuals desiring to migrate to the Gulf States or Europe for employment. Authorities in Somaliland previously reported an increase in the transporting or kidnapping of children and unemployed university graduates, who later transit Ethiopia and Sudan and are sometimes held hostage by networks in Libya en route to Europe and the Middle East. Trucks transporting goods from Kenya to Somalia sometimes return to Kenya with young girls and women; traffickers procure these young girls and women and exploit them in brothels in Nairobi or Mombasa or send them to destinations outside Kenya. Undocumented Ethiopians in northern Somalia also remain vulnerable to trafficking as they seek employment in Puntland and Somaliland to fund subsequent travel to the Middle East. Ethiopian children travel to Somaliland seeking employment but may instead be forced to beg on the streets."},"South Africa":{"April":2.0,"Asylum Seekers":"2","August":4.0,"December":0.0,"February":1.0,"Friday":0.0,"Global Population":57792.52,"January":3.0,"July":2.0,"June":3.0,"Life Expectancy":63.86,"March":5.0,"May":5.0,"Monday":9.0,"November":3.0,"October":3.0,"Population below $1.90 a day":"18.9","Saturday":4.0,"September":3.0,"Sunday":3.0,"Thursday":5.0,"Tuesday":4.0,"Violence against civilians":34,"Wednesday":9.0,"fatalities":["1","1","0","2","1","2","1","1","1","2","0","1","1","1","0","1","1","2","1","1","1","1","1","1","6","1","0","3","1","0","0","0","1","1"],"government_effort":"NA","introduction":"  WATCH LISTThe Government of South Africa does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. The government demonstrated significant efforts during the reporting period by investigating 82 potential trafficking cases, prosecuting 23 potential traffickers, and convicting eight traffickers, two under the Prevention and Combating of Trafficking in Persons Act (PACOTIP). The government also arrested several low level officials for complicity in cross-border trafficking. The South Africa Police Service (SAPS) finalized standard operating procedures (SOPs) for implementation of PACOTIP and the government trained front-line responders on its provisions. The government identified significantly more victims over the previous reporting period and referred them to care, upgrading 12 of 14 shelters to provide comprehensive psycho-social assistance to victims. The government also conducted numerous public awareness raising activities. However, the government did not demonstrate increasing efforts overall compared to the previous reporting period. Although the government convicted eight traffickers, four received suspended sentences, which were inadequate compared to the seriousness of the crime. Official complicity and allegations of official complicity affected the government's prosecution, protection, and prevention efforts and there were significant concerns for victim protection. The implementing regulations for PACOTIP's immigration provisions have not been promulgated since its enactment in 2013, and officials lacked adequate training on identification measures, which occasionally led the government to arrest, detain, and deport victims. The government sometimes denied foreign nationals protective services, especially if they chose not to participate in an investigation. For the second consecutive year, the government's lack of sufficient funding for anti-trafficking efforts prevented front-line responders from fully implementing the anti-trafficking law. Therefore South Africa was downgraded to Tier 2 Watch List.

A councillor in Jozini, KwaZulu-Natal was murdered on New Year's day.","prevention":"The government made inadequate efforts to prevent trafficking. NPA and DOJ oversaw a national task team and six provincial task teams, which met quarterly to discuss counter-trafficking efforts and worked collaboratively to address challenges. The government conducted national awareness-raising activities during the reporting period. In November, DSD organized marches in multiple provinces at the beginning of its 16 Days Against Sexual and Gender-Based Violence campaign, which included anti-trafficking messages. In partnership with civil society, SAPS organized an anti-trafficking awareness campaign in Mpumalanga province. KZN and Western Cape provincial task teams used an interagency protocol to guide law enforcement interactions with women in prostitution; however, other task teams ceased meeting or functioning altogether. However, a lack of a well-funded, full-time anti-trafficking coordination team within the government limited the effectiveness of these task teams. The government made efforts to reduce demand for commercial sex. The Cape Town Metro Police Department operated a vice squad that arrested an unknown number of individuals soliciting commercial sex. The government did not provide anti-trafficking training to its peacekeepers prior to their deployment abroad on international peacekeeping missions. In coordination with an international organization, the government provided anti-trafficking training for its diplomatic personnel. ","prosecution":"The government maintained uneven and inadequate prosecution efforts. Official complicity in trafficking crimes remained a concern. The PACOTIP of 2013 criminalized sex and labor trafficking and prescribed penalties of up to life imprisonment, a fine of up to 100 million South African rand ($8.1 million), or both. The penalties were sufficiently stringent; however, with regard to sex trafficking, by allowing for a fine in lieu of imprisonment, the prescribed punishment was not commensurate with those for other serious crimes, such as rape. The implementing regulations for PACOTIP's immigration provisions found in sections 15, 16, and 31(2)(b)(ii) have not been promulgated. The Sexual Offenses Act (SOA) also criminalized the sex trafficking of children and adults and prescribed penalties of up to 20 years imprisonment; these penalties were sufficiently stringent and, with respect to sex trafficking, commensurate with other serious crimes, such as rape. The Basic Conditions of Employment Act of 1997 (BCEA), amended in 2014, criminalized forced labor and prescribed maximum penalties of three to six years imprisonment. In addition, the Children's Amendment Act of 2005 prescribed penalties of five years to life imprisonment or fines for the use, procurement, or offer of a child for slavery, commercial sexual exploitation, or to commit crimes. Where relevant, prosecutors sometimes relied on the Prevention of Organized Crime Act of 1998 in combination with SOA, which added additional charges\u0160such as money laundering, racketeering, and criminal gang activity\u0160and increased penalties of convicted defendants.The Department of Priority Crime Investigation reported it investigated 82 potential trafficking cases and collaborated closely with the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) to compile evidence and build cases. The government initiated prosecutions of 23 cases compared to six cases in the previous year, and it obtained convictions of eight traffickers, compared to 11 traffickers convicted in 2016. The government sentenced two traffickers to terms of imprisonment; one trafficker received two consecutive life sentences and the other trafficker received 25 years imprisonment. The government convicted six additional traffickers, four of whom received suspended sentences; one case was withdrawn due to the suspect's death, and one case was overturned on appeal and resulted in an acquittal. The government did not report action on pending prosecutions from previous years, some of which have been pending for multiple years. The government has made little progress in prosecution of traffickers connected to international syndicates involving Nigerian, Thai, Chinese, Russian, or Bulgarian traffickers, who dominate the commercial sex industry in several South African cities; NGOs reported police officers received bribes from crime syndicates. The government 389SOUTH AFRICAdid not sufficiently fund agencies responsible for implementing the PACOTIP, leading to uneven enforcement of the law. NGOs reported local police stations often declined to investigate trafficking cases, even when NGOs provided case information, because of inadequate resources and training on PACOTIP. A lack of awareness of PACOTIP among law enforcement officers remained a significant barrier to its implementation; for example, in one training session, a law enforcement officer denied the existence of PACOTIP. However, SAPS did finalize SOPs for the implementation of PACOTIP for the first time. The government arrested several border guards complicit in assisting smugglers and traffickers to pass through South Africa's borders, but did not prosecute or convict any complicit officials. There were allegations for the second consecutive year that officials within Department of Home Affairs (DHA) produced fraudulent birth certificates, passports, and other identification documents that facilitated trafficking crimes. NGOs reported some police officers solicited commercial sex acts from victims. Immigration officials, private security companies, and airline officials may have been involved in facilitating trafficking operations at international airports.Although the majority of trafficking victims in South Africa are labor trafficking victims, the government did not comprehensively monitor or investigate forced child labor or the labor trafficking of adults in the agricultural, mining, construction, and fishing sectors. Department of Labor (DOL) inspectors continued to use administrative provisions within the BCEA as their core enforcement mechanism and rarely referred cases for criminal investigation. Although NGOs reported a lack of training across all agencies hindered the government's anti-trafficking efforts as a whole, the government conducted various trainings during the reporting period. In coordination with an international organization, the Department of Justice (DOJ) and NPA conducted two workshops for criminal justice practitioners on trafficking in persons. Department of Social Development (DSD) conducted a training for DHA on victim identification, and reporting and referral mechanisms. DSD also trained 198 social workers, five SAPS officers, three DHA officials, and a DOL representative throughout six training workshops on child exploitation and the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders in the implementation of PACOTIP. The NPA conducted four anti-trafficking training sessions for 53 prosecutors, covering PACOTIP, other relevant legislation used to try trafficking crimes, prosecutorial approaches, and trafficking case law. DOJ convened a two-day workshop at which representatives from all relevant agencies for every province came together to learn from South African and international anti-trafficking experts. Eighty high-level, empowered, passionate officials learned about best practices and protocols for fighting trafficking, from front-line responders to prosecutors.","protection":"The government had mixed protection efforts. The government identified 399 victims and referred them to care, compared to 220 victims in 2016. In six cases, the government's response was cause for concern; four victims reportedly disappeared, one was reported missing from the police station and may have been returned to her traffickers, and the government incarcerated the sixth victim for holding a fraudulent visa. Of the 399 victims identified, 305 were victims of forced labor, 66 were victims of sex trafficking, 19 were exploited in domestic servitude. The overwhelming majority of victims were from South Africa; other victims were from Thailand, Lesotho, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Ghana, Nigeria, Eswatini, Bulgaria, and Tanzania. A lack of adequate funding resulted in a lack of training on victim identification, which led to unlawful arrests and detentions of trafficking victims during the reporting period. A government-wide lack of funding for anti-trafficking efforts led to front-line responders occasionally denying cases of trafficking to avoid assuming responsibility for costs of protective service provision. In some cases, victims did not receive protective services for more than two months after a referral was made. This waiting time was tripled in the case of male labor trafficking victims who waited at least six months for care and, when it was ultimately delivered, it was only as a result of an NGO assuming responsibility. The government continued oversight of and partial funding for 14 accredited NGO-run multipurpose shelters and continued to oversee 17 NGO-run safe houses designed to temporarily shelter victims before transfer to an accredited shelter. The government provided a stipend on a per-person, per-night basis to the safe houses. There was only one shelter, in Gauteng, that could provide care for male trafficking victims. DSD trained 58 officials who comprised site verification teams responsible for formally accrediting shelters that provided protective services for victims. In coordination with an international organization, DSD conducted an assessment of all 14 DSD-accredited shelters; 12 were upgraded to the minimum standards to provide comprehensive psycho-social assistance to victims. The government provided shelters accessible to persons with disabilities that provided limited services for victims with disabilities; however, it is unclear if any victims received these services during the reporting period. Some government-run shelters refused to receive trafficking victims due to security, drug addiction, or cultural concerns. DSD ran a nine-week rehabilitation program to address the psycho-social well-being of victims and paid for victims to receive residential treatment at rehabilitation centers for overcoming drug addiction. Not all provinces had such centers and it is unclear how many victims participated in the rehabilitation program during the reporting period. The government operated a network of 55 Thuthuzela Care Centers (TCCs)\u0160full service crisis centers to assist victims of rape and sexual violence, including potential trafficking victims; it is unknown if TCCs assisted any victims of trafficking during the reporting period. Per DSD policy, staff prevented both adults and children from leaving shelters unaccompanied. Rapid-response teams comprised of government agencies and NGOs in Gauteng, Mpumalanga, Western Cape, and KZN continued to coordinate protective services, including shelter, for victims. DSD, which is responsible for designating and certifying trafficking victim status, continued to accept victims from law enforcement and coordinate their placement in registered shelters.SAPS, DSD, NPA, DHA, and DOJ had shared formal procedures to identify and refer trafficking victims to care, in accordance with PACOTIP. Implementation of these procedures varied by department and province; not all officials were aware of referral procedures. SAPS was criticized for not identifying victims. Furthermore, the government occasionally denied foreign nationals protective services, especially if they chose not to participate in an investigation. NGOs reported that front-line officials responsible for receiving referrals were often unreachable and that DSD and SAPS were sometimes not informed of their responsibilities to certify and refer victims, a necessary step before victims could receive care of any kind. Furthermore, some SAPS officers regularly failed to follow referral guidelines. Some officials had difficulty 390SOUTH AFRICAidentifying labor trafficking victims and differentiating between trafficking and smuggling crimes. SAPS did not always screen women and LGBTI persons in prostitution for trafficking indicators; officials sometimes charged them with prostitution and other violations. LGBTI persons, particularly transgendered persons, were especially vulnerable to trafficking due to social stigmatization; however, there was one shelter dedicated solely for victims from the LGBTI community, in the Western Cape. There were multiple reports that victims and potential victims were detained or incarcerated during the reporting period. Male labor trafficking victims remained largely unidentified and were frequently detained, deported, jailed, or fined. One Zimbabwean child trafficking victim who was exploited in forced labor was not given a court appearance for three months until he turned 18, at which point he was detained as an illegal immigrant and handed over to DHA for deportation. In another case, one NGO reported that three potential child victims were identified at a notoriously corrupt border crossing and subsequently detained; no assessment was conducted to determine whether they had endured trafficking or would qualify for asylum. One NGO continued its collaboration with DHA to screen and identify potential trafficking victims prior to deportation. Through this initiative, DHA and the NGO conducted more than 100 screenings and referred an unknown number of victims to care.Officials encouraged victims to participate in the investigation and prosecution of traffickers and the government provided security and long-term care for an unknown number of victims who did so during the reporting period. However, some hurdles inhibited progress in providing justice and protection for victims. A lack of language interpretation continued to impede the investigation of trafficking cases, prosecution of suspected offenders, and screening of victims. PACOTIP provides trafficking victims relief from deportation; however, regulations to implement this provision were not promulgated. As a result, unless foreign victims actively participated in law enforcement investigations and law enforcement petitioned DHA on their behalf, victims faced the possibility of deportation. DHA often required foreign nationals to renew their immigration paperwork every 30 days, which placed an unnecessary financial and logistical burden on the NGOs providing care for victims. NGOs reported that in some cases DHA doubted trafficking victimization and used this as justification to deny access to immigration documentation and the asylum process. In instances where DHA denied such access, it did not always carry out substantive follow-up to determine if trafficking crimes had been committed, nor did it always coordinate with the appropriate front-line responders to identify potential trafficking victims. Sometimes foreign victims lacking appropriate documentation or residency status were not allowed to study or work for the duration of an investigation or court proceeding, thus sometimes limiting foreign victims' willingness to testify in court. Foreign national victims did not always have the same access to health care as South African victims. DSD policy required evidence of force, fraud, or coercion immediately after victims' rescue and their classification as victims of trafficking to facilitate placement in facilities. There was an insufficient number of psychologists trained on human trafficking who could provide expert testimony in court. ","recommendation":"Investigate and prosecute officials suspected of complicity in trafficking crimes; promulgate the immigration provisions in sections 15, 16, and 31(2)(b)(ii) of PACOTIP and cease efforts to deny access to immigration relief, including the asylum process, on the basis of trafficking victimization; fund and increase efforts to fully implement PACOTIP and related regulations; increase efforts and resources to identify trafficking victims, including to screen for trafficking indicators among vulnerable populations, including potential deportees and women in prostitution, and continue to train law enforcement and social service officials on these provisions and victim identification measures; amend anti-trafficking law to remove sentencing provisions that allow fines in lieu of imprisonment; increase efforts to investigate, prosecute, and convict traffickers, including employers who use forced labor, under PACOTIP; ensure victims are issued the appropriate immigration identification documents in order to receive protective services; train law enforcement and social service providers to use a victim-centered approach when interacting with potential victims and recognize initial consent is irrelevant; establish a translator database to expand the capacity to seek justice for foreign trafficking victims; replicate the coordinated anti-trafficking law enforcement and victim referral mechanisms of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) and Western Cape in all provinces; extend the availability of drug rehabilitation services to trafficking victims; certify or establish additional shelters for male victims; provide anti-trafficking training for diplomatic personnel and troops deployed abroad; and institute formal procedures to compile national statistics on traffickers prosecuted and victims assisted.","tier":"TIER 2","traffick_profile":"As reported over the past five years, South Africa is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking. South African children were recruited from poor, rural areas to urban centers, such as Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban, and Bloemfontein, where girls were subjected to sex trafficking and domestic servitude and boys are forced to work in street vending, food service, begging, criminal activities, and agriculture. Many children, including those with disabilities, were exploited in forced begging. A non-consensual and illegal form of ukuthwala, a traditional faux-abduction of women for marriage, was practiced in some remote villages in Eastern Cape province. Local criminal rings organized child sex trafficking, Russian and Bulgarian crime syndicates facilitated trafficking within the Cape Town commercial sex industry, and Thai and Chinese nationals often organized the sex trafficking of Asian men and women. Nigerian syndicates dominated the commercial sex industry in several provinces. To a lesser extent, syndicates recruited South African women to Europe and Asia, where some are forced into prostitution, domestic servitude, or drug smuggling. Law enforcement reported that traffickers employed forced drug use to coerce sex trafficking victims.Thai and Chinese women remained the largest group of identified foreign victims. Women and girls from Brazil, Eastern Europe, Asia, and neighboring African countries are recruited for work in South Africa, where some are subjected to sex trafficking, domestic servitude, or forced labor in the service sector, or transported to Europe for similar purposes. An NGO in Western Cape province reported an increased number of Nigerian sex trafficking victims, many coerced through voodoo rituals, and more Nigerians in domestic servitude. Central African women are reportedly subjected to forced labor in hair salons. Foreign and South African LGBTI persons are subjected to sex trafficking. Foreign male forced labor victims have been identified aboard fishing vessels in South Africa's territorial waters; NGOs estimated 10 to 15 victims of labor trafficking disembark each month in Cape Town. Young men and boys from neighboring countries migrate to South Africa for farm work; some are subjected to forced labor and subsequently 391SOUTH SUDANarrested and deported as illegal immigrants. Forced labor is reportedly used in fruit and vegetable farms across South Africa and vineyards in Western Cape province. Pakistanis and Bangladeshis are subjected to bonded labor in businesses owned by their co-nationals. Official complicity\u0160including by police\u0160in trafficking crimes remained a serious concern. Some well-known brothels previously identified as locations of sex trafficking continued to operate with officials' tacit approval."},"South Sudan":{"April":22.0,"Asylum Seekers":"6","August":15.0,"December":39.0,"February":22.0,"Friday":31.0,"Global Population":10975.93,"January":18.0,"July":19.0,"June":43.0,"Life Expectancy":57.6,"March":23.0,"May":28.0,"Monday":57.0,"November":41.0,"October":40.0,"Population below $1.90 a day":"42.7","Saturday":45.0,"September":17.0,"Sunday":42.0,"Thursday":58.0,"Tuesday":44.0,"Violence against civilians":327,"Wednesday":50.0,"fatalities":["0","1","3","0","0","1","3","0","0","0","0","0","5","0","0","0","2","1","1","0","0","7","0","0","0","0","0","2","1","2","0","0","1","1","2","0","0","1","0","7","0","0","1","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","8","0","0","1","0","0","1","7","0","5","0","0","1","1","2","2","1","0","0","0","0","10","5","7","5","0","1","0","0","0","1","7","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","7","7","4","0","0","0","1","0","0","3","3","1","2","0","2","0","0","0","2","0","0","7","0","1","1","1","3","0","1","8","4","0","0","2","1","1","1","0","0","0","0","0","1","2","5","0","0","1","2","0","7","1","0","6","1","0","1","4","0","1","0","2","3","0","6","1","2","4","1","1","0","0","18","1","3","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","1","0","1","1","0","2","2","2","0","4","0","0","0","32","1","2","1","0","0","1","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","3","4","4","0","10","0","1","2","0","1","0","0","0","5","2","2","3","1","1","0","0","2","1","2","1","0","1","0","2","4","1","0","1","1","1","1","10","1","1","3","2","10","0","1","0","0","0","0","4","4","1","3","0","4","2","1","1","22","1","1","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","3","0","1","4","4","1","5","1","4","0","0","0","1","2","1","1","28","4","1","0","0","10","2","0","0","3","1","7","1","2","4","1","0","0","0","8"],"government_effort":"NA","introduction":"The Government of the Republic of South Sudan does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so; therefore South Sudan remained on Tier 3. Despite the lack of significant effort, the government took some steps to address trafficking, including cooperating with the National Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration Commission (NDDRC) and an international organization to release 311 child soldiers, and passing the 2017 Labor Law, which reportedly will expand the forms of trafficking criminalized in the country. However, the government continued to unlawfully recruit and use child soldiers, at times by force; did not fully implement its existing action plan to demobilize child soldiers; and did not hold any members of the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) criminally accountable for these unlawful acts. Authorities did not report any investigations or prosecutions of forced labor or sex trafficking crimes and officials generally lacked understanding of existing laws prohibiting human trafficking. The government made negligible efforts to protect trafficking victims and continued to indiscriminately arrest and imprison individuals for prostitution violations, including child sex trafficking victims, without screening for indicators of trafficking.

September and December 2018, rebels abducted 74 civilians across nine events in various locations in Central Equatoria (including Alero, Logo, Lasu, and Yembe (approx coordinates from humanitarian map used for Yembe at prec2), and several unspecified locations along the Yei-Kaya road. Nine events recorded (six with NAS as actor1, three with SPLM-IO as actor1) all at time prec3, with eight events using specific locations, and one event using Yei at geoprec3. On Dec 30th, a pastoralist was killed in Duk Pagak county (Jonglei state, coordinates for Pagak used at prec2), by unknown attackers. There is no further information. On or before December 30th, three people were burned to death in a house in the area of Kabo (coodinates for Audo Kabo, Central Equatoria, used). Motive unclear. Between December 2018 and early April 2019, SSPDF and NSS forces abducted 41 civilians from areas in and around Yei and Lobonok (Central Equatoria). Reports indicate many were subject to abuse and\/or torture whilst in detention. Four events coded at time prec3. On December 29th, an armed group attacked an unspecified area(s) along the Yei-Kaya road. An unspecified number of UNMISS personnel (nationality unspecified) were reported to have been abducted, and held for ranson, whilst looting of civilian homes also took place. The two factions of the SSNMC (one of which has joined the current peace agreement, the other breakaway group which has not) accused one another of being behind the attack (for the time being, an UAG is coded).

The National Aliens Committee\u0160tasked in 2015 to address trafficking issues in the country\u0160met three times during the reporting period, but did not undertake any notable anti-trafficking efforts. The government did not have a national action plan to combat trafficking and trafficking awareness remained low among government officials and the public. Although senior SPLA representatives acknowledged the military's recruitment of children into its ranks, forces continued to actively recruit child soldiers, at times by force, and did not implement its existing action plan to demobilize currently identified child soldiers. Formal enlistment procedures required an age assessment (many South Sudanese people do not have birth certificates); however, implementation was lacking due to poor command and control and ongoing conftict throughout the country. The government continued its annual campaign against sexual exploitation, designed to raise awareness among vulnerable groups and how to identify, prevent, and report gender-based violence crimes, including trafficking. Authorities failed to make efforts to prevent or address the labor exploitation of South Sudanese nationals working abroad or foreign nationals within South Sudan. The government made no discernible efforts to reduce the demand for forced labor or commercial sex acts during the reporting period. The government did not provide anti-trafficking training for its diplomatic personnel. South Sudan is not a party to the 2000 UN TIP Protocol.","prosecution":"The government continued negligible anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts. The 2008 penal code and 2008 Child Act criminalized some forms of labor and sex trafficking. Article 277 of the penal code prohibited forced labor and prescribed a penalty of up to two years imprisonment, or a fine, or both; these penalties were not sufficiently stringent. However, Articles 278 and 279 increased the penalties for forced labor when the offense involved kidnapping, abduction, or the transfer of control over a person to up to seven years imprisonment, or a fine, or both. Article 276 criminalized buying or selling a child for the purpose of prostitution and prescribed a punishment of up to 14 years imprisonment and a fine, which was sufficiently stringent and commensurate with punishment prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. Articles 254 and 258 criminalized the procurement of a child for prostitution and the facilitation of the prostitution of a child by the child's parent or guardian and prescribed penalties of up to 10 years imprisonment and a fine; these penalties were also sufficiently stringent and commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. The criminal code did not explicitly criminalize adult sex trafficking. Article 282 prohibited and prescribed a sufficiently stringent punishment of up to seven years imprisonment for the sale of a person across international borders. Articles 31 and 32 of South Sudan's 2008 Child Act prohibited the recruitment and use of children for military or paramilitary activities, and prescribed punishments of up to 10 years imprisonment for such crimes. In October 2017, the government adopted the Labor Act of 2017, which prohibited forced labor and prescribed penalties of up to five years imprisonment, a fine, confiscation of property, cancellation of a business license, or closure of business, or a combination of these penalties; these penalties were sufficiently stringent. The government did not report any investigations, prosecutions, or convictions for trafficking crimes. Despite the ongoing unlawful recruitment and use of child soldiers by the SPLA and its allied militias, the government has never held an offender criminally or administratively accountable for such crimes. Lack of capacity throughout the justice sector impeded law enforcement efforts. Courts lacked lawyers, judges, and defense attorneys knowledgeable of trafficking issues and laws, and resources to investigate and prosecute most crimes, including human trafficking, were scant. The government did not report any investigations, prosecutions, or convictions of government employees complicit in human trafficking offenses; however, corruption and official complicity in trafficking crimes remained significant concerns and impeded law enforcement action during the year. ","protection":"The government increased efforts to protect victims. The government cooperated with the NDDRC and an international organization to release 311 child soldiers\u0160the first such release 392SPAINsince 2015; however, government forces continued to recruit and use child soldiers. Lacking a formal mechanism to identify potential victims, security forces continued to indiscriminately arrest individuals in prostitution without screening, including child sex trafficking victims and others who may have been victims. The Ministry of Women, Child, and Social Welfare ran a transition center in Yambio with support from an international organization. The center provided interim care and support to children and mothers rescued from violent extremist organizations, including potential trafficking victims. There were no specialized services available for trafficking victims.Social stigma and fear of punitive law enforcement actions discouraged victims\u0160particularly those subjected to sex trafficking\u0160from communicating with law enforcement authorities. There were no laws or policies to protect victims from prosecution for crimes committed as a direct result of being subjected to trafficking. The government did not provide legal alternatives to the removal of foreign victims to countries where they would face hardship or retribution; nor did it otherwise encourage victims to assist in the investigation and prosecution of trafficking crimes. ","recommendation":"Cease all unlawful recruitment and use of children younger than 18 years of age by the SPLA and its associated militias; pursuant to article 1.10 of the Agreement on the Resolution of the Conftict in South Sudan, immediately release child soldiers under the command or inftuence of the SPLA and affiliated militias and, in partnership with international organizations, transfer them to appropriate civilian rehabilitation and reintegration programs; use the 2008 Child Act to investigate, prosecute, and convict military officials allegedly complicit in the recruitment, use, and sexual exploitation of children; investigate and prosecute suspected trafficking offenses, and convict and punish traffickers, including complicit government officials; provide financial support to the SPLA's Directorate of Child Protection to facilitate efforts to identify perpetrators and refer cases to civilian courts; establish and implement procedures to prevent penalization of trafficking victims for crimes committed as a direct result of being subjected to trafficking; train law enforcement and judicial officials to recognize trafficking victims, particularly among vulnerable groups such as children, individuals in prostitution, and internally displaced persons; develop an inventory of service providers and train government officials on procedures to refer victims to these entities to receive care; conduct a public awareness campaign to educate the public on all forms of human trafficking; develop and implement a national anti-trafficking strategy that incorporates government ministries, law enforcement, NGOs, and civil society actors; improve data collection efforts; pass a civil registry bill to provide a framework for the government to register births, adoptions, name changes, marriages, and deaths in South Sudan; and accede to the 2000 UN TIP Protocol.","tier":"TIER 3","traffick_profile":"As reported over the past five years, South Sudan is a source and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking. South Sudanese women and girls, particularly those from rural areas or who are internally displaced, are vulnerable to domestic servitude throughout the country. Some of these women and girls are sexually abused by male occupants of the household or forced to engage in commercial sex acts. South Sudanese girls are subjected to sex trafficking in restaurants, hotels, and brothels in urban centers\u0160at times with the involvement of corrupt law enforcement officials. Children working in construction, market vending, shoe shining, car washing, rock breaking, brick making, delivery cart pulling, gold mining, and begging may be victims of forced labor. Girls are forced into marriages, at times as compensation for inter-ethnic killings; some may be subsequently subjected to sexual slavery or domestic servitude. South Sudanese and foreign business owners recruit men and women from neighboring countries\u0160especially Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, and Somalia\u0160as well as South Sudanese women and children, with fraudulent offers of employment opportunities in hotels, restaurants, and construction; many are forced to work for little or no pay or are subjected to sex trafficking. Some traffickers operate in organized networks within the country and across borders.Violent conftict continued throughout the year, increasing the number of internally displaced persons to 1.9 million and the number of refugees in neighboring states to nearly 2.43 million as of January 2018. These groups, including orphaned children, are at increased risk of trafficking and other forms of exploitation. Unaccompanied minors in camps for refugees or internally displaced persons are particularly vulnerable to abduction for sex or labor trafficking. Inter-ethnic abductions, as well as abductions by external criminal elements, continue between some communities in South Sudan, especially in legacy Jonglei, Unity, and Upper Nile states. Traffickers subject abductees to forced labor or sex trafficking. An international organization estimated government and opposition-affiliated forces have recruited more than 19,000 child soldiers since the start of the conftict in 2013, and recruitment continues. The use of children in armed forces remains widespread and is on the rise for the fourth consecutive year. Government forces use children to fight and perpetrate violence against other children and civilians, or to serve as scouts, escorts, cooks, and cleaners, or to carry heavy loads while on the move. According to the Agreement on the Resolution of the Conftict in South Sudan, signed by the warring parties in August 2015, SPLA and the SPLA in Opposition (SPLA-IO) committed to the immediate and unconditional release of child soldiers under their command or inftuence, to be carried out by international organizations. However, throughout the reporting period both groups continued to retain, recruit, and use child soldiers, including on the front-line, and evidence persists of the re-recruitment of numerous children. The majority of cases of recruitment and use of child soldiers were documented in Unity State, and over half of all verified cases are reportedly perpetrated by the SPLA. Child soldiers are also present within groups affiliated with the opposition; international observers verified instances in several of the country's legacy states, including Western Equatoria, Upper Nile, Jonglei, Warrap, Central Equatoria, and Northern Bahr el Ghazal. During the reporting period, international observers noted an increase in the reported use of girls in both governmental and non-governmental opposition armed groups."},"Sri Lanka":{"April":1.0,"Asylum Seekers":"19","August":0.0,"December":6.0,"February":0.0,"Friday":5.0,"Global Population":21228.76,"January":1.0,"July":4.0,"June":3.0,"Life Expectancy":76.81,"March":3.0,"May":0.0,"Monday":5.0,"November":9.0,"October":6.0,"Population below $1.90 a day":"0.8","Saturday":2.0,"September":2.0,"Sunday":10.0,"Thursday":4.0,"Tuesday":6.0,"Violence against civilians":35,"Wednesday":3.0,"fatalities":["4","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","1","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","1"],"government_effort":"NA","introduction":"The Government of Sri Lanka does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. The government demonstrated 395SRI LANKAincreasing efforts compared to the previous reporting period; therefore Sri Lanka remained on Tier 2. The government demonstrated increasing efforts by identifying more potential trafficking victims and partnering with an international organization to launch a national awareness campaign and train hundreds of local, district, and state officials and civil society members on victim identification and referral procedures. The government also amended legislation to allow diplomatic missions to record evidence and take statements from victims or witnesses overseas, which resulted in the referral of 29 statements related to alleged human trafficking to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) for further investigation. However, the government did not meet the minimum standards in several key areas. For the fourth consecutive year, the courts did not convict any traffickers under the government's trafficking statute, although they continued to convict potential trafficking cases under the procurement law for obtaining a person to become a prostitute. Only one person convicted for procurement served prison time; two other convictions were suspended. The capacity of local officials to proactively identify victims was low and observers reported authorities did not make adequate efforts to screen for indicators of human trafficking among individuals arrested or charged for prostitution, vagrancy, or immigration offenses. The government provided no specialized services to male victims and maintained specific requirements for migration of female migrant workers and those migrating for domestic work, which observers stated increased the likelihood women would migrate illegally and therefore heightened their vulnerability to human trafficking. Complicity remained a problem; while the government secured a conviction of one official for preparing forged documents and sentenced him to one year in prison, the government did not initiate any new investigations or prosecutions of allegedly complicit officials during the year.","iso3":"LKA","latitude":["5.9831","9.6833","9.267999999999999","9.6685","7.86","6.5063","6.848","6.9319","7.2165","9.6833","6.9319","6.9319","9.3961","6.0833","6.9319","6.9319","6.3041","6.0355","6.9319","7.0744","7.5205","9.6685","9.0566","6.7438","9.6685","6.9319","6.4788","6.9319","6.4134","6.3429","7.4305","6.773","6.9319","7.3555","6.4134"],"location":["Kudawella","Kopay","Mullaitivu","Jaffna","Dambulla","Godakawela","Maharagama","Colombo","Akkaraipattu","Kopay","Colombo","Colombo","Kilinochchi","Kebiliyapola","Colombo","Colombo","Urubokka","Imaduwa","Colombo","Ja Ela","Rattota","Jaffna","Kanakarayankulam","Ingiriya","Jaffna","Colombo","Beruwala","Colombo","Kataragama","Uragasmanhandiya","Bathalayaya","Moratuwa","Colombo","Mullegama","Kataragama"],"longitude":["80.7313","80.05","80.815","80.0074","80.6517","80.6434","79.9265","79.8478","81.8538","80.05","79.8478","79.8478","80.3982","80.6667","79.8478","79.8478","80.6312","80.3857","79.8478","79.8919","80.6798","80.0074","80.4584","80.176","80.0074","79.8478","79.9828","79.8478","81.3346","80.0927","80.9908","79.8816","79.8478","80.6055","81.3346"],"notes":"On 25 Dec, in Kudawella (Tangalle, Hambantota), two unidentified and alleged gun-for-hires opened fire inside the Kudaawella Fishery Harbour, killing 4--including fishermen and a government employee--and injuring at least 5.

Police officials fatally shot a motorcyclist who refused an order to stop for inspection in Kataragama on 20 January 2018.","prevention":"The government increased efforts to prevent trafficking. The inter-ministerial anti-trafficking task force increased its coordination through more frequent meetings; during the reporting period the task force met seven times and a separate project steering sub-committee met seven times on prevention activities. The government continued to implement the national action plan to combat human trafficking. In partnership with an international organization, the government launched a public awareness campaign on five national television channels. The campaign featured a hotline number run by an international organization, which received several calls seeking information and assistance, including from overseas, which were referred to the government for investigation. The government also distributed leaftets, posters, and brochures to local officials, NGOs, and the general public. The NCPA held awareness events on child sex tourism in October 2017 in coastal areas with local officials and schools. SLBFE maintained its ban on migration of male and female domestic workers younger than age 21 and female domestic workers younger than age 25 to Saudi Arabia and younger than age 23 to other parts of the Middle East. SLBFE also required all female migrant workers below age 45 to submit a \ufb01family background report\ufb02 to ensure the woman did not have children younger than age five. Observers reported any ban on migration increased the likelihood of migrating illegally and therefore heightened the vulnerability to human trafficking. During the reporting period, SLBFE's legal division filed 107 cases against licensed and 50 cases against unlicensed recruiters for fraudulent practices, compared with a total of 315 cases in 2016. SLBFE conducted multiple awareness trainings for recruitment agents and potential migrant workers and in February 2018 SLBFE, CID, and officials from the attorney general's office went to Sri Lankan missions in Oman, Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates (UAE) to train mission staff on combating human trafficking. In February 2018, MFE and the Government of UAE signed a memorandum of understanding to produce increased transparency, monitoring, and compliance with migrant worker recruitment systems; reportedly, only recruitment agencies registered with SLBFE will be able to offer overseas employment to domestic workers. The MFE did not have the legal authority to regulate foreign employment recruitment sub-agents under SLBFE, which officials recognized as a problem contributing to trafficking. MFE partnered with an international organization to study foreign employment recruitment intermediaries and stated the government continued to explore an amendment to the Foreign Employment Act to address the oversight of sub-agents and the investigative authority of MFE officials. The government did not report efforts to reduce the demand for forced labor during the reporting period; however, in an attempt to reduce demand for the domestic sex trade, the government's awareness campaign highlighted the negative social consequences of procuring commercial sex. The government provided anti-trafficking training to military personnel prior to their deployments abroad on international peacekeeping missions. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs initiated training for diplomats and other officials who would be deployed to overseas missions, including SLBFE and defense officers, on prevention and identification of trafficking. 397SUDAN","prosecution":"The government maintained overall law enforcement efforts to address human trafficking. Section 360(C) of the penal code criminalized labor and sex trafficking and prescribed penalties of two to 20 years imprisonment and fines, which were sufficiently stringent and, with respect to sex trafficking, commensurate with those prescribed for other serious offenses, such as rape. The government also frequently used section 360(A), a procurement statute that criminalized obtaining a person to become a prostitute, with or without the consent of the person, to prosecute sex trafficking cases. Procurement crimes carried lesser penalties of two to 10 years imprisonment and fines, and these cases were often brought before magistrate judges who were generally only authorized to issue sentences of up to two years imprisonment. During the reporting period, CID and the police initiated 15 trafficking investigations, compared with nine investigations in 2016. Of the 15 investigations, 10 were categorized as possible forced labor cases, four as sex trafficking, and one as selling of a child for exploitation. The government initiated 28 prosecutions during the reporting period, four under section 360(C), which included three sex trafficking cases and one case of selling a child for exploitation, and 24 under the procurement statute. This was compared to 35 prosecutions in the previous reporting period and 12 prosecutions in 2015. For the fourth consecutive year, the courts did not convict any traffickers under section 360(C). Courts did, however, convict three persons under the procurement statute compared with seven persons during the previous reporting period and one person in 2015. Courts suspended two of the three imprisonment sentences; instead of imprisonment, the convicted were ordered to pay fines of 1,500 Sri Lanka rupees (LKR) ($10) and 5,000 LKR ($33), with default sentences of six months imprisonment and one month respectively imposed if the convicted were unable to pay the fines. In addition, the court ordered one of the convicted to pay restitution to the victim of 50,000 LKR ($330). The sentences of fines alone were not sufficiently stringent to deter the crime. The court sentenced one person to five years imprisonment and ordered the convicted to pay a fine of 1,000 LKR ($7) and restitution to the victim of 75,000 LKR ($490). The government's reliance on procurement charges resulted from police not thoroughly investigating potential human trafficking cases for elements of force, fraud, or coercion and difficulty securing evidence from victims. Prosecutors could pursue procurement cases without the cooperation of the victim. In November 2017, the government amended the Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses Act to authorize Sri Lankan diplomatic missions to record evidence and take statements from a victim or witness outside Sri Lanka. The anti-trafficking unit of the SLBFE, created in the previous reporting period, received 38 complaints regarding possible trafficking crimes during the reporting period; of these complaints, 19 were referred from Sri Lankan embassies. The SLBFE referred 12 of these cases to the CID's anti-trafficking unit for further investigation. Separately, Sri Lankan diplomatic missions referred 29 witness and victim affidavits from abroad to CID for investigation. In two cases, CID coordinated with foreign authorities in Cyprus and Thailand on investigations involving Sri Lankan victims. Official complicity in trafficking offenses remained a problem. Some sub-agents reportedly worked with officials to procure forged or modified documents, or genuine documents with falsified data, to facilitate travel abroad. In the previous reporting period, the Ministry of Foreign Employment (MFE) referred six cases of officials allegedly creating fraudulent documents to the police for further investigation. At the end 396SRI LANKAof the current reporting period, the government reported one official had been convicted of preparation of forged documents and sentenced to one year imprisonment, with an additional year of imprisonment suspended, and a fine of 125,000 LKR ($810); the other five investigations remained ongoing at the end of the reporting period. ","protection":"The government made modest improvements in protection efforts. The government reported identifying 46 potential trafficking victims, an increase compared with 23 potential victims identified in 2016. The government utilized standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the identification and referral of potential victims to protection services and in partnership with an international organization, conducted multiple trainings on victim identification and referral for 875 members of civil society and local, district, and state officials, including health, probation, police, immigration, CID, and National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) officials. However, the government had not issued circulars and directives to relevant agencies to guide staff to follow the SOPs and both the government and members of civil society stated the capacity of local officials to identify trafficking victims was low. Observers reported Sri Lankan authorities jailed and charged individuals, possibly including children, for prostitution, vagrancy, or immigration offenses without adequate efforts to evaluate whether they were victims of trafficking. An NGO reported sex trafficking victims were reluctant to approach law enforcement for help due to perception of police hostility and social stigma associated with being a victim. The Ministry of Women and Child Affairs continued to operate a shelter for female victims of violence, including trafficking victims, although the shelter did not house any trafficking victims during the reporting period. The government did not have specialized rehabilitation services available for male trafficking victims. The government referred child victims to child-specific rehabilitation centers; however, an NGO reported in the previous reporting period that some children who were not identified as victims and instead arrested for prostitution crimes were held in government detention centers. The government acknowledged the possible arrest and detention of children who may be sex trafficking victims. The government provided training for 100 child probation officers and institutional staff and conducted a survey to identify and refer such victims to rehabilitation services. SLBFE continued to operate 11 short-term shelters for female migrant workers in distress at Sri Lankan diplomatic missions in 10 countries. During the reporting period, the shelters served 2,392 migrant workers; authorities did not report how many were trafficking victims. SLBFE also continued to operate a transit shelter near the Colombo international airport for returning male and female migrant workers who encountered abuse abroad. In 2017, the transit shelter provided medical, counseling, transportation, food, or accommodation, as needed, to 1,692 female and 1,546 male migrant workers, some of whom may have been trafficking victims. Foreign victims who were officially identified had access to the same rehabilitation services as domestic victims. During the reporting period, the government provided a foreign victim with protection, medical, legal, and translation services. An international organization and NGO provided counseling and shelter and the victim was repatriated with assistance from the government and the international organization. The victim identification SOPs allow foreign victims who cooperate in prosecutions to receive a visa extension until the end of the trial; however, the government did not provide foreign victims with legal alternatives to deportation to countries where they might face hardship or retribution after trial completion or for victims who did not cooperate with prosecution. ","recommendation":"While respecting due process, improve efforts to investigate and prosecute suspected traffickers, including complicit officials, and convict and punish offenders with sentences commensurate with other serious crimes; increase efforts to proactively identify trafficking victims and train officials on victim identification and referral procedures, especially to ensure victims are not detained or otherwise penalized for unlawful acts, such as immigration violations or prostitution, committed as a direct result of having been subjected to human trafficking; improve protection services to ensure identified victims, including men and children, receive specialized care services; take steps to eliminate all recruitment fees charged to workers by labor recruiters and instead ensure they are paid by employers; expand the foreign employment bureau's (SLBFE) mandate to include the regulation of sub-agents; promote safe and legal migration and ensure migration regulations do not discriminate on the basis of gender; and increase efforts of the task force to institutionalize sustained government coordination efforts.","tier":"TIER 2","traffick_profile":"As reported over the last five years, Sri Lanka is primarily a source, destination, and, to a lesser extent, a transit country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking. Some of the Sri Lankan men, women, and children who migrate to the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and Afghanistan to work in the construction, garment, and domestic service sectors are subjected to forced labor. Before leaving Sri Lanka, many migrant workers go into debt to pay high recruitment fees imposed by unscrupulous labor recruitment agencies\u0160most of them members of Sri Lanka's association of licensed foreign employment agencies\u0160and their unlicensed sub-agents. Migrant laborers, especially women, receive a monetary advance as an incentive to move abroad, only to be trapped in debt bondage upon arrival at their destination. Some recruitment agencies commit fraud by changing the agreed upon job, employer, conditions, or salary after the migrant's arrival. Some Sri Lankan women are subjected to forced prostitution in Cyprus, Maldives, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and elsewhere. Sri Lanka is a transit point for Nepali women subjected to forced labor in the Middle East. Within the country, women and children are subjected to sex trafficking in brothels. Boys are more likely than girls to be exploited in commercial sex in coastal areas for child sex tourism. Children, individuals with physical deformities, and those from socially vulnerable groups are forced to beg or engage in criminal activity in Sri Lanka's largest cities. Some child domestic workers in Colombo, generally Tamils from the tea estate region, are subjected to physical, sexual, and mental abuse, non-payment of wages, and restrictions of movement\u0160indicators of labor trafficking. In recent years, a small number of women from other Asian and Central Asian countries have been subjected to forced prostitution in Sri Lanka. Police reportedly accept bribes to permit brothels to operate, some of which exploit trafficking victims. Sub-agents collude with officials to procure fake or falsified travel documents to facilitate travel of Sri Lankans abroad.

Despite these achievements, the government continued to penalize victims for crimes they committed while subjected to trafficking; did not make efforts to address sex trafficking or identify any sex

Reasons unclear.","prevention":"The government increased efforts to prevent trafficking, but some Sudanese policies may have increased risks of exploitation among vulnerable populations. A 2016 policy required South Sudanese immigrants to register formally within one week of arriving in Sudan. This policy restricted South Sudanese access to legal work and potentially exposed them to exploitative work situations. The government sporadically granted protections\u0160including legal representation and residency\u0160to foreigners who lacked refugee or asylum status, but only registered such applications at original points of entry, which compelled some fteeing persecution in other parts of the country to do so clandestinely. The National Committee to Combat Trafficking, consisting of 19 government ministries, met three times during the reporting period, drafted and finalized a national action plan with support from an international organization, used multiple media channels to raise awareness of the crime, and in December 2017 met with NGOs to increase coordination on anti-trafficking service provision; however, at the end of the reporting period, the government did not allocate a budget for the national action plan, and only began implementation of its awareness raising programs. The government did not make efforts to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts and forced labor, and did not report providing anti-trafficking training for its diplomatic personnel. ","prosecution":"The government increased law enforcement efforts. The 2014 anti-trafficking law criminalized some forms of trafficking, but failed to define what constituted exploitation. Additionally, inconsistent with international standards, the law required a demonstration of force, fraud, or coercion to constitute a child sex trafficking offense, and therefore did not criminalize all forms of child sex trafficking. The law prescribed between three and 10 years imprisonment for base offenses involving adult male victims and between five and 20 years imprisonment for offenses involving adult female and child victims or involving additional aggravating circumstances; these penalties were sufficiently stringent and, with respect to sex trafficking, commensurate with the penalties prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. Article 14 of the Sudan Armed Forces Act of 2007 criminalized recruiting children younger than 18 years old by members of the armed forces, enslaving civilians, or coercing civilians into prostitution, and prescribed penalties between three years imprisonment and death. Unlike in previous years, following increased training by the government and international organizations, senior officials and working level law enforcement and judicial officials demonstrated a clearer understanding of the differences between 398SUDANmigrant smuggling and human trafficking, although some conftation of kidnapping, smuggling, and trafficking still existed at the working level. During the reporting period, the government reported investigating 99 total trafficking cases involving 179 suspected traffickers. These cases included several instances of suspected forced labor, but no alleged sex trafficking cases. The government prosecuted 94 of those cases involving 160 suspects, and convicted seven traffickers under the 2014 anti-trafficking law to sentences ranging from three years to death, compared with 450 investigations of potential traffickers during the previous reporting period; however, previous year's reporting likely included cases of migrant smuggling among other crimes. International organizations alleged that some police officers and local officials in Sudan were complicit in trafficking crimes, especially in the east of the country. The government reported prosecuting and convicting two complicit officials\u0160one police officer and one colonel in the Sudan Armed Forces (SAF)\u0160and sentenced the police officer to 10 years in prison under the 2014 anti-trafficking law, compared with no prosecutions or convictions of complicit officials reported during the previous five years. The government also reported convicting six officials for trafficking and sentencing them to between 10 and 15 years imprisonment in a special court in eastern Sudan. In 2017, the Ministry of Interior funded and launched the Trafficking Unit under the Organized Crime Directorate, and trained 100 detectives across eight states (Kassala, Gedaref, Red Sea, Blue Nile, Khartoum, Gezira, Nile River, and Northern State) on investigation procedures for trafficking cases during the reporting year. In 2017, the government's Judicial and Legal Sciences Institute, in collaboration with the Ministry of Justice, partnered with an international organization to provide four five-day trainings titled \ufb01Strengthening the Capacity of the Criminal Justice System in Sudan to Address Human Trafficking\ufb02 for 83 male and female law enforcement officers, judges, prosecutors, defense lawyers, and social workers across eight of Sudan's 18 states. In August 2017, 20 representatives from the judiciary, Criminal Prosecution Office, Office of the Attorney General, various law enforcement branches, Ministry of Justice, and social workers assisted in the development of the training curriculum in a trainer-of-trainers model to increase their ability to effectively identify and prosecute human trafficking cases using the 2014 Anti-Trafficking law. In October 2017, the Police Training Authority, under the direction of the Ministry of Interior, provided training to law enforcement personnel on victim identification, care, and protection principles, with a focus on victim-centered approaches. Additionally in 2017, in partnership with the African Union and a multilateral organization, the Ministry of Interior launched the Regional Operational Centre on Trafficking (ROCK), which will help facilitate international trafficking investigations between source, transit, and destination countries along commonly used trafficking routes. International donors have pledged support for the ROCK, but have not yet disbursed funding. ","protection":"The government increased efforts to identify trafficking victims subjected to forced labor but failed to identify victims of sex trafficking and likely penalized some victims for crimes they may have committed while being subjected to trafficking. Although victim protection remained a substantial gap in the government's anti-trafficking efforts, it took significant steps through the trainings listed in the previous section to increase the capacity of law enforcement and other first responders to proactively identify victims and refer them to care, in partnership with NGOs and international organizations. In 2017, the government reported identifying 400 potential trafficking victims through the course of law enforcement activities, compared with 142 during the previous year; however, the government did not report referring any victims to care. The government did not have systematic procedures to identify trafficking victims, nor did it consistently use a standard mechanism to refer victims to protective services. The government also lacked a mechanism to screen for trafficking for use by officials engaging with vulnerable populations. As a result, trafficking victims who may have committed unlawful acts as a direct result of being subjected to trafficking were likely detained or deported from Sudan\u0160or prosecuted\u0160without access to protections afforded to them. Vulnerable individuals such as persons in prostitution, migrants, and refugees may not have reported abuses due to fear of retaliation by an employer or arrest by government authorities. Authorities\u0160particularly in eastern Sudan\u0160continued to charge some trafficking victims for immigration violations and held them in custody throughout the duration of court processes, and some victims participating in investigations risked retaliation by traffickers. During the reporting year, the NCCW and the Ministry for Social Welfare increased efforts to prevent the use of child soldiers within the SAF and its auxiliaries through the implementation of the National Action Plan to Prevent the Recruitment and Use of Children in Armed Conftict. In 2017, the government strengthened its age assessment and screening processes, established disciplinary procedures for those caught engaging in child recruitment, and increased awareness raising campaigns across the military, down to the unit level. The government also coordinated with international organizations to conduct monitoring and verification visits in eight conftict states and through the headquarters of its paramilitary Rapid Support Forces and facilitated the release of 21 child soldiers from non-governmental armed forces in the Darfur region. The NCCW also reported partnering with international organizations to provide temporary shelter and services to 34 victims of trafficking, and 21 child soldiers. Shortcomings remained in the reintegration process following the release of child soldiers due to coordination challenges within government agencies and between the government and social services. International organizations noted that the lack of a centralized process led child soldiers to be treated as prisoners of war and held in prolonged detention. The government referred victims to international organizations and civil society who provided shelter, medical care, psycho-social support, translation services, and witness protection to some victims of trafficking; however, the government did not report if any potential trafficking victims stayed or received care in either of two safe houses in Kassala state that an international organization operated with funding from a nongovernment body. Although the government did not report providing support to victims of trafficking in safe houses, NGOs indicated that victims did receive support from at least one safe house during the reporting period. Authorities did not permit victims to leave the shelters unchaperoned. The Domestic Workers Act of 2008 provided a legal framework for employing and registering domestic workers with limited labor rights and protections. The government did not report if any domestic workers were registered and protected under the law during the reporting period. Per the Asylum Act, foreign victims of trafficking identified as in need of international protection by police authorities or the judiciary were directed to the Commission for Refugees (COR) and an international 399SUDANorganization where they had the opportunity to receive refugee status and apply for asylum; the government did not report any individuals pursuing or receiving this benefit during the year.An international organization reported the government installed video and camera equipment in court houses across the country which allowed victims and witnesses to give testimony in separate rooms to prevent re-traumatization as a result of involvement in criminal proceeding. The government set up a mock trial room with this technology at its training center for prosecutors and judges, the government-funded Judicial and Legal Sciences Institute. ","recommendation":"Ensure all government security forces maintain vigilance to prevent the use of child soldiers by government forces; implement the anti-trafficking law to increase prosecutions and convictions of traffickers and complicit officials, including those allegedly responsible for sex trafficking and as distinct from migrant smuggling or kidnapping crimes; increase training for law enforcement officials on distinguishing trafficking from other crimes, and establish procedures for authorities to identify and provide protective services to trafficking victims among vulnerable populations, such as domestic workers, women and children in prostitution, refugees and asylum-seekers, and foreign migrants; ensure victims are not punished for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being subjected to human trafficking; National Council for Child Welfare (NCCW) drafts standard operating procedures (SOPs) for child soldier reintegration, and implements the SOPs in coordination with government ministries and civil society; regularly convene the National Committee to Combat Trafficking; amend the 2014 anti-trafficking law to criminalize sex trafficking of children in the absence of coercion and define exploitation; allow victims full freedom of movement from government safe houses; increase coordination with NGOs and civil society on victim protection; implement and dedicate adequate resources to the national anti-trafficking action plan; provide adequate protective services for all trafficking victims, regardless of their participation in law enforcement or prosecution efforts, and ensure protective services to victim witnesses; institute regular anti-trafficking training for relevant government officials and Sudanese diplomats posted abroad; develop awareness raising campaigns that address all forms of trafficking, including forced labor and sex trafficking.","tier":"TIER 2 WATCH LIST","traffick_profile":"As reported over the past five years, Sudan is a transit, source, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and, to a lesser extent, sex trafficking and child soldiering. For the second consecutive year, traffickers increased their recruitment of male migrants to Sudan for purposes of forced labor or situations indicative of trafficking under false pretenses of employment. Street children in Khartoum\u0160including Sudanese and unaccompanied migrant children from West and Central Africa\u0160who beg in the streets, and work in public transportation and large markets are particularly susceptible to forced labor; some experience sexual abuse and extortion. Human rights groups observe children working in brick-making factories, gold mining, collecting medical waste, street vending, and agriculture; these children are exposed to threats, physical and sexual abuse, and hazardous working conditions, with limited access to education or health services, making them highly vulnerable to trafficking. Sudanese women and girls, particularly internally displaced persons or those from rural areas, and refugee women are vulnerable to domestic servitude; Sudanese girls are also vulnerable to sex trafficking. Sudanese law prohibits the recruitment of children as combatants and provides criminal penalties for perpetrators; however, children remained vulnerable to recruitment and use as combatants and in support roles by non-governmental armed groups and militias, primarily in Sudan's conftict zones of Darfur, South Kordofan, and Blue Nile. An international organization reported that the non-governmental Sudan Liberation Movement-Minni Minnawi, Sudan Liberation Army-Abdul Wahid, and Sudan Liberation Army-Popular Defense may have recruited and used child soldiers, and verification was ongoing at the end of the reporting period. Due to regional instability and conftict, Sudan hosts more than 2.9 million people of concern, including refugees, internally displaced persons, and asylum-seekers. These individuals are vulnerable to trafficking due to their lack of economic stability and access to justice. East Sudan hosts over 107,000 refugees, the majority of which are Eritreans. The government's COR partnered with NGOs and international organizations to assist asylum-seekers arriving in three reception areas. European support for the government's efforts to limit irregular migration routes through Sudan to Europe has forced migration underground and therefore increased the vulnerability of migrants to abuse and exploitation by traffickers, complicit security forces, and criminal networks, primarily in the east of the country. A human rights organization reported that approximately 30,000 Eritrean, Ethiopian, and other African asylum-seekers\u0160a population vulnerable to trafficking due to their economic fragility and lack of access to justice\u0160are temporarily housed in Khartoum waiting to travel to Europe. During the reporting year, Eritreans represented the highest proportion of trafficking victims in Sudan\u0160mainly in the east\u0160due to the consistent ftow of refugees and asylum-seekers and their youth demographic. Ethiopian women are particularly vulnerable to domestic servitude in private homes in Khartoum and other urban centers; some Ethiopian women are forced into prostitution in Khartoum and experience debt bondage. Somalis represent a significant portion of smuggled individuals who become, or are at risk of becoming victims of trafficking. Anecdotal reports indicate Syrian refugees, including children, are observed begging on the streets in Khartoum and are vulnerable to exploitation. Analogous to Syrian nationals, some Yemenis fteeing conftict in their homeland sought asylum in Sudan, and their economic vulnerabilities upon arrival likely motivate their onward migration to Europe. Due to the ongoing conftict in South Sudan, there was an increase in South Sudanese refugees across Sudan, many of whom remained vulnerable to exploitation in Sudan. An international organization continued to document cases of West and Central African nationals\u0160primarily from Niger, Mali, and Chad\u0160who arrived in Sudan via irregular migratory routes and were subsequently vulnerable to trafficking. Anecdotal evidence also suggests that Chinese women working for small-scale Chinese companies, such as restaurants and hotels, may be subjected to forced labor or prostitution. Darfur remained a favored route to Libya, as the porous border and sustained insecurity allow traffickers to operate with impunity across the region. The previously defunct Egyptian route is being used again in connection with the migration inftux to Europe; Sudanese citizens and other African nationalities are allegedly utilizing this course. In past years, some Sudanese citizens en route to Europe via Egypt were detained in the Sinai Peninsula where they were vulnerable to exploitation. Eritrean nationals are abducted at border crossings, extorted for ransom, and abused by smugglers linked to the Rashaida and Tabo tribes, although other cross-border tribes also take part in trafficking; some of those abducted are forced to perform domestic or manual labor and experience various types of 400SURINAMEabuse, indicative of trafficking. Sudanese police and border guards allegedly facilitate the trafficking of Eritrean nationals and allow potential victims to be transported across security checkpoints or international borders without intervention. Sudanese citizens are subjected to forced labor, domestic servitude, and sex trafficking abroad. Some Sudanese men who voluntarily migrate to the Middle East as low-skilled laborers are subjected to forced labor. The government reported Sudanese children are exploited in forced begging and street vending in Saudi Arabia, especially during the Hajj season. Sudanese criminal gangs deceptively promise Sudanese nationals employment in Libya, but instead sell them to Libyans who subject them to forced labor in agriculture or mining.

The government demonstrated significant efforts during the reporting period by establishing the first police unit dedicated to investigating trafficking crimes; increasing investigations of alleged traffickers, including labor recruitment firms that may have been complicit in the exploitation of migrants; providing funding to an NGO for awareness-raising activities; establishing a hotline for potential victims; and continuing to monitor for forced labor of children in the annual cotton harvest. However, the government did not demonstrate increasing efforts compared to the previous reporting period. Endemic corruption contributed to the transport of victims across borders, yet the government did not report any investigations, prosecutions, or convictions of government officials complicit in human trafficking offenses. Although the government continued to publicize the ban on child labor in the cotton harvest, there were reports that citizens were coerced into manual labor, including the cotton harvest. For the third consecutive year, it did not implement its victim protection law, leaving officials without victim identification and referral procedures, and resulted in inadequate victim protection services. Therefore Tajikistan was downgraded to Tier 2 Watch List.

On 29 July, the four foreign cyclists (two Americans, a Dutch and a Swiss citizen) were killed when they were run down by a car along a scenic highway near Safobakhsh, close to Danghara in southern Tajikistan. The attackers plowed into the cyclists with their car, then exited and stabbed the cyclists. Islamic State (IS) claimed responsibility and issued a video on July 31 showing five men pledging allegiance to the group under the organization's black flag and criticizing Tajikistan because it \"has been occupied by infidels.\" On 21st July 2018, servicemen of State Border Service of Tajikistan illegally detained two servicemen of the State Border Service of the Kyrgyz Republic and two citizens of the Kyrgyz Republic who were passing through the territory of the settlement of Voruh in Tajikistan. At detention Tajik border guards behaved aggressively and inflicted light bodily injuries to one of the Kyrgyz border guards. In the summer of 2018, a man was arrested as part of a group of 15 former members of the banned IRPT. Shortly after his release, he committed suicide leaving a video where he declared having been tortured by law enforcements [coded to Khujand]. In July 2018, police detained a man in Yovon district [coded to Yovon] and beat, kicked and gave him electric shocks until he confessed of having committed a stabbing. The victim of the stabbing later stated that the suspect was not the perpetrator and he was released. On 28 March, a resident of Dushanbe was detained by law enforcers and reportedly was tortured by them in order to provide confession to alleged crime possession of drugs. Later he was transferred from custody to hospital in serious condition but died there. As reported on 20 April, in mid-March a resident of Muminabad was reportedly taken to a local police office and severely beaten by law enforcers, because of his state of intoxication by alcohol. According to his relative, even one month later he still suffered from the consequences of the beating. Exact date of the attack was not specified. On 21 January, a Jehovah's Witness was detained in Khujand and beaten during interrogation by police officers. He was hospitalized with a concussion. On 7 January, border guards of Tajikistan opened fire at fishermen near Konibodom. One was killed, another wounded. Reportedly the guards opened fire at the fishermen's car, when leaving the area. On 7 January, Tajik border guards opened fire at a car with five passengers, wounding two and killing one, near the town of Isfara at the border with Kyrgyzstan. The car allegedly disobeyed orders and tried to escape.","prevention":"The government modestly increased efforts to prevent human trafficking. The 2014 law established a framework for the government to address human trafficking and a national anti-trafficking commission tasked with coordinating the government's anti-trafficking efforts and developing a national plan. The government did not report any efforts of the commission or any actions related to the implementation of the national action plan in 2017. It also did not report on the efforts of the working group established in 2016 to ensure uniformity in the implementation of the action plan, referral mechanism, and 2014 anti-trafficking law. The Ministry of Education continued to disseminate letters to local governments highlighting prohibitions against the use of child labor in the cotton harvest. Government-funded campaigns targeted potential victims, local officials responsible for preventing trafficking, and school authorities who had previously mobilized children in the cotton harvest. The government assigned an unspecified number of inspectors to conduct monitoring of the cotton harvest, continuing a practice begun in 2010 in cooperation with NGOs. International 411TANZANIAorganizations, however, reported that no independent monitoring of the cotton harvest was conducted during the year.In January 2018, the government launched a hotline service for potential victims that operated 24 hours a day; it did not report the number of calls received relevant to potential trafficking crimes. A foreign-donor-funded and NGO-run hotline focused on aiding migrants, including potential trafficking victims, reported assisting 2,238 individuals; most calls were related to legal rights as migrants. In 2017, the government provided 98,000 Tajikistani somoni ($11,200) to a local NGO for trafficking awareness-raising. The government continued to conduct anti-trafficking courses for officials, school administrators, and law students. The government did not provide any other anti-trafficking training for its diplomatic personnel. Tajik law required entities engaged in recruitment of workers for employment abroad to obtain licenses from migration authorities and provided punitive measures for violations; in 2017 the Prosecutor General's Office initiated a criminal investigation against three private firms for fraudulent recruitment; the investigation remained ongoing. The Tajik migration service provided migrants with information on the risk of trafficking prior to travel abroad. In partnership with the migration service, lawyers employed by an international organization provided legal consultation on migration and trafficking at migration service support centers. The government made efforts to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts by investigating and prosecuting purchasers of commercial sex. The government did not report any efforts to reduce the demand for forced labor.","prosecution":"The government maintained its anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts, but did not provide information on prosecutions or convictions of traffickers. The 2003 criminal code, amended in 2004 and 2008, criminalized all forms of labor trafficking and some forms of sex trafficking. Article 130.1 criminalized labor and some forms of sex trafficking and prescribed penalties of five to eight years imprisonment, which are sufficiently stringent and, with regard to sex trafficking, commensurate with penalties 410TAJIKISTANprescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. Inconsistent with international law, article 130.1 required a demonstration of forced, fraud, or coercion to constitute a child sex trafficking offense, and therefore did not criminalize all forms of child sex trafficking. Article 132 criminalized recruitment for sexual or other exploitation through fraud\u0160but not through coercion\u0160and carried a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment; these penalties were not sufficiently stringent nor, with regard to sex trafficking, commensurate with other grave crimes, such as rape. Article 167 prohibited the buying and selling of children, prescribing five to eight years imprisonment and several other criminal code provisions include trafficking crimes, such as article 130.2, which criminalizes the use of slave labor, and article 241.2, which criminalizes the use of minors in the production of pornography.The government investigated 42 cases involving 65 suspected traffickers in 2017, compared to 18 cases involving 24 suspected traffickers investigated in 2016. The government did not report initiating any prosecutions or convicting any alleged traffickers in 2017, compared with 13 prosecutions and 10 convictions in 2016. International organizations reported that the government prosecuted 22 cases under article 130.1 during the first 11 months of 2017. The organization reported that 13 additional cases were identified under article 132, and 10 under article 167; it is unclear how many of these cases involved trafficking crimes. Media reports indicate that courts convicted at least three traffickers for their roles in recruiting Tajik women with false promises of overseas employment in the United Arab Emirates and Turkey, where the women subsequently endured forced prostitution. Sentences ranged from eight to ten years imprisonment. The government did not report any investigations, prosecutions, or convictions of government employees complicit in human trafficking offenses; however, corruption and official complicity in trafficking crimes remained significant concerns, inhibiting law enforcement action during the year. Endemic corruption facilitated transport of victims across borders and through inspection points. In 2017, the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA) established the first unit dedicated to investigate only trafficking cases. The unit consisted of 30 officers\u016018 in the Dushanbe office headquarters, and 12 across four regional offices. The MIA continued to conduct training on human trafficking for new staff as part of its training academy curriculum. In partnership with NGOs, the government trained investigators, prosecutors, and judges on the 2014 victim protection law, victim-centered approaches, and investigative techniques.","protection":"The government maintained minimal efforts to identify trafficking victims, but provided no protection services. The government identified and referred 15 victims to international organizations for assistance, an increase from six victims in 2016 and eight in 2015. Four additional victims were referred by NGOs to an international organization. Civil society groups and international organizations provided protective services to 13 trafficking victims in 2017. The government provided repatriation assistance to one citizen, identified as a trafficking victim in Saudi Arabia. The government made no progress in implementing the 2014 victim protection law, which set forth the provision of victim services; formalized the roles of agencies tasked with providing services; established government standards for service delivery among providers, including governmental agencies and NGOs; and mandated a national referral mechanism, which the government finalized in 2016, but did not report implementing in 2017. As a result, authorities remained without a formal system for identifying trafficking victims and referring them to services. The government did not report providing any services to trafficking victims and did not directly shelter victims; the country's last shelter for trafficking victims closed when foreign funding expired in April 2016. The government's committee on women and family affairs' crisis center in Dushanbe offered women free legal and psychological assistance among other services but did not assist any trafficking victims. NGOs working on domestic violence also occasionally provided trafficking victims with medical and psycho-social care, legal and vocational training, and assisted in family reunification; however, the government did not provide financial support to such organizations.Law enforcement officials sometimes temporarily detained sex trafficking victims but later released and referred them for assistance. Women in prostitution have reported instances of sexual violence by law enforcement officials. Furthermore, as law enforcement officials routinely deported foreign migrant workers and did not attempt to identify trafficking victims proactively among men and women in prostitution or forced labor, it was possible officials prosecuted, detained, or penalized trafficking victims for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being subjected to human trafficking. In January 2018, the government announced that police raids had uncovered 280 brothels in Tajikistan, and registered 1,991 women as working in prostitution; the government did not report screening any of these women for indicators of trafficking. Despite provisions in the 2014 law for security measures for trafficking victims, the government did not keep victims' personal information confidential or provide protection for victim witnesses or their advocates. The law provided foreign victims with the right to request temporary residency, which could be extended for one year following the completion of a criminal case, based on the victims' cooperation with law enforcement agencies, although no such cases were reported in 2017. The 2014 victim protection law did not link other victim benefits to a victim's participation in a trial and provided victim services regardless of legal status or prior consent to participate in subsequently identified trafficking crimes. ","recommendation":"Implement standard operating procedures for identifying trafficking victims and referring them to care, including any victims of forced labor in the cotton harvest; train law enforcement to screen men and women in prostitution for signs of trafficking and ensure sex trafficking victims are not penalized for prostitution offenses; while respecting due process, vigorously investigate and prosecute suspected traffickers, including officials complicit in trafficking, and convict and appropriately sentence perpetrators; increase measures and dedicate funding or in-kind support to provide comprehensive care to victims and encourage their assistance in the investigation and prosecution of traffickers either directly or via partnerships with NGOs; amend existing anti-trafficking legislation to more closely conform with international standards, specifically to criminalize child sex trafficking in the absence of force, fraud, and coercion; continue to enforce the prohibition against the forced labor of children in the annual cotton harvest by inspecting fields during the harvest in collaboration with local officials and NGOs; take substantive action to end the use of forced adult labor in public works projects and in the annual cotton harvest; improve the collection of anti-trafficking law enforcement data; continue to provide anti-trafficking training or guidance for diplomatic personnel and other government employees, including law enforcement officers, border guards, and customs officials, to prevent their engagement or facilitation of trafficking crimes.","tier":"TIER 2 WATCH LIST","traffick_profile":"As reported over the past five years, Tajikistan is a source and, to a lesser extent, destination country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor, and a source and destination country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Extensive economic migration exposes Tajik men, women, and children to the risk of exploitation. Tajik men and women are subjected to forced labor in agriculture and construction in Russia, UAE, Kazakhstan, and, to a lesser extent, in other neighboring Central Asian countries, Turkey, and Afghanistan. There are growing cases of men being subjected in Tajikistan to labor exploitation in agriculture, construction, and at markets, as well as limited reports of sex trafficking. Women and children from Tajikistan are subjected to sex trafficking primarily in Turkey, UAE, and Russia, and also in Saudi Arabia, Kazakhstan, and Afghanistan, as well as within Tajikistan. The government required its citizens to participate in manual labor, such as cleaning roads and park maintenance, and threatened that government officials could be penalized if their spouses do not participate.Women and minors are increasingly vulnerable to trafficking. In some cases, migrant laborers abandon their families, making women more vulnerable to trafficking as sole providers for their families. The Russian re-entry ban has changed the nature of labor migration in Tajikistan. As many as 152,000 Tajik migrants remained banned in 2017, and although government data indicates a decline in the departure of prospective male labor migrants, Tajik women are departing in search of work at an increased rate\u0160from 2015 to 2016 there was a 27 percent increase observed among women. Other migrants prefer to stay in irregular status in Russia, and face greater risks of exploitation and deportation, than risk being banned after visiting family in Tajikistan. Many migrants are leaving for Russia with no intent to return to Tajikistan. International organizations estimate that the number of Tajik citizens living and working in Russia is approaching one million. Some women who traveled to Syria or Iraq with promises of marriage were instead sold into sexual slavery. Tajik women and girls are transported to Afghanistan for the purpose of forced marriage, which can lead to domestic servitude, sex trafficking, and debt bondage. Tajik children are subjected to sex trafficking and forced labor, including forced begging, in Tajikistan and Afghanistan. Tajik children and adults may be subjected to forced labor in agriculture\u0160mainly during Tajikistan's fall cotton harvest\u0160and in dried fruit production. Afghan and Bangladeshi citizens are vulnerable to forced labor in Tajikistan, including in the construction industry."},"Thailand":{"April":15.0,"Asylum Seekers":"1","August":19.0,"December":19.0,"February":14.0,"Friday":16.0,"Global Population":69428.45,"January":17.0,"July":8.0,"June":18.0,"Life Expectancy":76.93,"March":9.0,"May":13.0,"Monday":21.0,"November":14.0,"October":11.0,"Population below $1.90 a day":"0","Saturday":31.0,"September":13.0,"Sunday":22.0,"Thursday":26.0,"Tuesday":29.0,"Violence against civilians":170,"Wednesday":25.0,"fatalities":["1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","2","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","0","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","0","0","1","0","1","1","1","2","1","0","1","1","0","1","1","1","1","1","2","1","1","1","2","1","0","1","2","1","1","1","0","0","1","0","1","0","0","2","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","0","1","5","1","1","1","1","4","1","1","1","1","1","2","1","2","1","2","1","1","1","2","1","1","1","1","2","0","1","1","1","1","0","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","0","1","1","1","1","1","2","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","2","2","1","2","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","0","1","1","1","1","0","1","1","1","1","3","1","1"],"government_effort":"NA","introduction":"The Government of Thailand does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. The government demonstrated increasing efforts compared to the previous reporting period; therefore Thailand was upgraded to Tier 2. The government demonstrated increasing efforts by prosecuting and convicting more traffickers, and decreasing prosecution time for trafficking cases through the use of specialized anti-trafficking law enforcement divisions. The government also investigated more cases of suspected official complicity in trafficking crimes and convicted 12 complicit officials in 2017, including 11 officials involved in the trafficking of Rohingya migrants. The government issued regulations to increase oversight of NGO-operated shelters and provide access to governmental financial support. It established an anti-trafficking task force composed of law enforcement, social workers, and NGOs to increase coordination of law enforcement and victim protection efforts; created a victim specialist program; and increased training for labor inspectors on forced labor. However, the government did not meet the minimum standards in several key areas. Officials identified fewer victims of forced labor and investigated fewer forced labor cases compared to the previous reporting period. Although the government continued to increase labor inspections in high-risk industries, inspections resulted in disproportionately few identified victims and criminal investigations. Official complicity continued to impede anti-trafficking efforts, and there were anecdotal reports that officials arrested, detained, and deported some potential victims for crimes committed as a direct result of being subjected to human trafficking. Victims and activists may have been deterred from reporting, and some officials may have been hesitant to pursue investigations of exploitation due to risks of facing criminal defamation charges brought by unscrupulous employers.","iso3":"THA","latitude":["6.763","6.8681","6.1418","6.7186","6.763","6.763","16.5453","16.9363","17.4108","6.8681","6.763","6.763","17.1266","6.2188","6.6919","6.8296","6.5168","6.0297","6.098","6.422000000000001","6.4232","6.1418","6.6223","6.3468","6.4936","6.5415","6.2663","6.3065","6.7429","6.686","6.73","6.2544","6.3049","8.1836","6.7489","6.8411","6.73","6.5964","6.73","6.73","6.8681","6.6816","6.73","6.7874","6.8681","6.73","7.7796","6.7598","6.73","6.5218","6.763","6.1136","6.73","6.73","6.73","6.73","6.7429","6.73","6.4153","6.73","6.8681","6.73","6.3599","6.3599","6.4118","13.7539","7.1988","6.7231","6.73","13.7539","13.7539","6.607","6.73","6.7598","6.73","5.9339","6.73","6.5168","6.2533","6.73","6.0783","6.73","6.73","6.73","6.3599","6.3382","6.73","6.73","6.73","6.73","6.6341","6.73","6.3545","6.73","6.6415","6.6567","6.73","5.9388","6.73","6.73","6.73","6.4153","6.6415","6.607","6.73","6.2663","6.73","6.2229","6.73","6.73","6.73","6.73","6.1703","6.5478","6.73","6.73","6.4992","19.8623","6.6448","6.73","6.73","6.73","13.8034","6.0783","6.73","6.7475","6.73","6.7817","6.3514","6.0105","6.2666","6.7598","6.73","6.73","6.7874","6.73","6.73","6.2594","6.73","6.4263","6.4676","6.73","6.73","6.4029","6.1441","6.73","6.73","6.763","6.8119","6.73","6.73","6.73","6.6848","6.73","6.73","6.73","6.5218","13.7539","6.7415","6.7974","6.3925","6.0297","13.7539","6.2967","6.3221","6.3221","6.3221","6.6103","6.8681","6.3221"],"location":["Krawa","Pattani","Na

It increased funding for migrant labor management and anti-trafficking efforts to 3.6 billion baht ($110.4 million) in fiscal year 2018 from 3.2 billion baht ($98.2 million) in fiscal year 2017. In September 2017, the cabinet approved the Second National Policy Strategies and Measures to Prevent and Suppress Trafficking in Persons, 2017-2021. It conducted campaigns through newspapers, television, radio, social media, billboards, and handouts to raise public awareness throughout the country. Given the low literacy rate and diversity of languages among at-risk persons, however, this information remained inaccessible to many vulnerable non-Thai speakers. The government and civil society groups operated a service center for fishermen to provide information on their rights, skills training, health screenings, and other resources. The government continued efforts to reduce costs for Thais in overseas guest worker programs, but excessive fees incurred by some Thai workers to obtain employment abroad made them vulnerable to debt bondage or exploitative conditions. Through government-to-government formal migration channels, the government facilitated 20,068 Thais to obtain employment abroad in 2017. Provincial employment offices provided training to more than 3,500 of these workers prior to their departure and MOL screened travel documents for departing workers at 25 checkpoints throughout the country; of 64,602 workers departing Thailand in 2017, 729 were prevented from traveling. In 2017, the government inspected 302 labor recruitment agencies that facilitated overseas and domestic employment of Thai workers and found unlawful practices in nine, resulting in license suspensions of eight agencies and the revocation of one agency's license. It initiated prosecutions against 287 illegal brokers (108 in 2016) under the Employment and Job-Seeker Protection Act. The government continued to grant citizenship to stateless persons in 2017 and issued a new regulation to provide legal residency to orphaned and non-Thai children born in Thailand. In an effort to prevent trafficking of children, child advocacy centers provided social service interventions, including acute care needs, to children vulnerable to exploitation, and childcare was offered at a service center for fishermen. MSDHS and MOL operated hotlines with operators ftuent in 20 foreign languages; the MSDHS hotline received 172 calls related to possible trafficking cases in 2017 (269 in 2016), leading to the identification of 109 child and 63 adult victims and prosecution of 73 cases. MSDHS increased the number of available hotline interpreters to 68 in 2017. Critical gaps in Thailand's labor laws preventing migrant workers from forming labor unions may have contributed to exploitation. In addition, NGOs and international organizations widely reported the government did not adequately enforce the application of minimum wages in sectors with a minimum wage and lacked legislation to require minimum wages in other sectors, especially in those sectors with high employment of migrant workers. Some also reported gaps in Thai policies related to migrant workers that exacerbated exploitation, such as no requirement that employment contracts be written in both Thai and workers' languages, lack of clear guidance to measure work and rest hours for workers aboard fishing vessels, and difficulty for workers to change employers. In June 2017, the government issued a royal ordinance concerning management of foreign worker employment, which required additional registration requirements for migrant workers and their employers, and strengthened penalties for employers of undocumented workers. However, the sudden announcement of the ordinance resulted in mass departures of thousands of undocumented workers who subsequently may have become vulnerable to exploitation. Following criticisms from stakeholders, the government delayed implementation of the decree until June 2018 to seek stakeholder input on amendments of the decree, as well as to allow migrant workers more time to obtain the necessary documents for legal employment under the decree. The government facilitated the establishment of 14 service centers in Thailand, in coordination with the governments of Burma, Cambodia, and Laos, to conduct nationality verification for undocumented migrant workers. The cabinet subsequently approved an amended decree in March 2018, adding protections for workers such as prohibiting the confiscation of identity documents, banning sub-contracted employees, and easing the ability for workers to change employers, which remained widespread concerns during the reporting period. In October 2017, DLPW required employers in the fishing sector to pay workers monthly through bank transfers. A government decree required migrant worker recruitment agencies to apply for a license and pay a deposit fee applied toward a foreign worker employment fund; unregistered agencies were liable to three years imprisonment and fines up to 60,000 baht ($1,840). Employers were also mandated to cover costs (excluding personal expenses such as passports, medical checks, and work permits) associated with bringing migrant workers to Thailand and back to their home countries when employment ends, such as recruitment fees and transportation costs. In 2017, 101 migrant worker recruitment agencies were licensed and the government inspected 97 agencies; the government prosecuted one agency in violation of the decree and imposed a fine of 20,000 baht ($610). While the number of migrant workers entering Thailand through formal government-to-government migration systems increased, greater usage of this mechanism continued to be impeded by lack of information, lengthy processing times, difficulties in changing employers, and high costs tied to corruption on both sides of the border. The government operated three post-arrival centers to assist migrant workers entering Thailand through these formal channels, as well as 10 migrant workers assistance centers; these centers assisted 345,204 workers in 2017 (105,647 in August 2016 to February 2017) by providing resources in multiple languages, including for trafficking awareness, and assisting the migrant workers to register with the government. The Ministry of the Interior and Ministry of Justice inspected 11,268 \ufb01high-risk\ufb02 adult entertainment venues and ordered 268 to cease business activities for five years; these inspections led to the prosecution of eight trafficking cases. DPLW conducted 1,693 labor inspections at high-risk workplaces, including sugarcane farms, garment factories, shrimp and fish processing facilities, pig farms, and poultry farms in 2017, finding 191 violations resulting in 12 prosecutions. In February 2017 the government called all Thai fishing vessels operating outside Thai waters back to port where they were put under close monitoring; the government had not authorized these vessels to continue fishing by the end of the reporting period. CCCIF, the Department of Fisheries, DLPW, and other relevant agencies developed a manual on SOPs for labor inspections to be conducted after the government reauthorizes Thai vessels to operate outside Thai waters. In addition, the government required fishing vessels operating within Thai waters to return to ports every 30 days for inspections. The government continued to screen for trafficking indicators among fishermen returning to Thailand and on fishing vessels in Thai waters, as well as among workers in seafood processing facilities. The CCCIF operated 32 PIPO centers plus 418TIMOR LESTE19 additional forward inspection points, which performed inspections at port, at sea, and on land to verify whether fishing vessels were operating legally and workers had contracts, work permits, and identity documents. The government increased the number of PIPO inspection teams from 64 to 85. MOL conducted inspections onboard 644 vessels in 2017 and found 34 violations of the law (15 in 2016); three cases were prosecuted as a result. In addition, the Royal Thai Navy conducted 3,927 on board inspections of fishing vessels in 2017 and suspended 110 vessels from operating for legal violations. However, the government did not report whether any of these inspections resulted in the identification of trafficking victims, and NGO observers asserted both at-port and at-sea inspections conducted by multidisciplinary teams of the CCCIF were conducted too quickly, in front of ship captains or in open settings, with inconsistent methods in different ports, or by interpretors without the presence of labor inspectors; and in some cases, inspections consisted only of a review of documents or inspectors did not board vessels or speak to crewmembers. Civil society and government officials expressed concerns that due to varying levels of enforcement at PIPO centers, some boat captains chose ports where inspections and enforcement were weaker. Some NGOs reported workers faced retaliation if they reported abuse to inspection teams, and asserted potential victims did not to report abuses to avoid long shelter stays which could result in financial or personal hardships. In 2017 the multidisciplinary teams of the CCCIF inspected 358 on-land seafood processing workplaces and found 142 cases of law and labor violations. The government issued administrative orders to suspend business operations for nine workplaces for 10 to 30 days. The government did not report how many of these violations had direct ties to trafficking. The government took steps to decrease the demand for commercial sex acts, including by investigating and prosecuting offenders who purchased children for commercial sex acts. To discourage child sex tourism, the government reported it denied entry to 74 known foreign sex offenders. The government developed and launched a video shown on ftights entering Thailand discouraging sex tourism. The Ministry of Tourism distributed more than 315,000 brochures discouraging sex tourism to businesses and tourism professionals and organized trainings for 800 local government officials, tourism sector workers, students, youth, and civil society organizations on prevention of child sexual exploitation in the tourism industry.","prosecution":"The government increased law enforcement efforts. The 2008 anti-trafficking law, as amended, criminalized sex and labor trafficking and prescribed penalties of up to 12 years imprisonment and a maximum fine of 1.2 million baht ($36,810) for offenses involving an adult victim, and up to 20 years imprisonment and 2 million baht ($61,350) for those involving a child victim. These penalties were sufficiently stringent and, with respect to sex trafficking, commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. The Ministry of Labor (MOL) drafted legislation to more clearly define forced labor in Thai law and create additional protections for victims; in 2018 the government sought input from the public on this draft law. The government reported investigating 302 trafficking cases (333 in 2016), initiating prosecutions against 638 suspected traffickers (493 in 2016), and convicting 466 traffickers (366 in 2016) in 2017. Despite reports of continued forced labor in Thailand, the government reported investigating fewer cases; authorities investigated 47 forced labor cases in 2017 (83 in 2016) and 16 in January through March 2018. The government reported 415THAILANDinvestigating significantly fewer cases of labor trafficking in the fishing industry in 2017; it investigated seven cases in 2017 (43 in 2016). In one case, the government sentenced a boat captain to four years imprisonment and ordered him to pay 450,000 baht ($13,800) in restitution to the victims. The government investigated and detained several vessels operating in international waters, leading to the identification of 50 exploited workers, including 35 trafficking victims and, in one case, the arrest of a broker and crew supervisor. To increase efficiency in prosecuting trafficking and illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing cases, in March 2018 the attorney general issued guidelines to prosecutors with descriptions of relevant charges and sentencing recommendations. Corruption and official complicity in trafficking crimes continued to impede anti-trafficking efforts, and the government sometimes utilized administrative punishments against suspected complicit officials, such as suspensions or transfers to new positions, rather than subjecting them to criminal prosecutions. However, the government increased efforts to address official complicity. In 2017, the government initiated investigations of 26 officials (10 in 2016), initiated prosecution of seven, and convicted 12 officials complicit in trafficking crimes (three convictions in 2016). In addition, from January through March 2018, it initiated criminal investigations of 20 officials, prosecuted eight, and convicted five. Of the 10 officials initially investigated in 2016, four remained under investigation, the office of the public sector anti-corruption commission referred three for prosecution, and the government chose not to pursue charges against three. In one prosecution completed in 2017, the government convicted 62 offenders, including 11 government officials, involved in the trafficking of Rohingya migrants; it sentenced convicted officials to prison terms ranging from 14 to 79 years. In addition, in March 2018, the government convicted four police officers who solicited bribes in exchange for not pressing charges against those involved in the exploitation of the Rohingya migrants; they were each sentenced to five years imprisonment. Following the adoption of the Beggar Control Act in 2016, the government increased efforts to investigate forced and child begging; it initiated 26 forced begging investigations in 2017, compared to eight in 2016. Police utilized DNA testing to determine the relationship between child victims of forced begging and the adults accompanying them, and the government prosecuted parents from neighboring countries who brought their children to Thailand more than once to engage in begging. Law enforcement officials cooperated with foreign counterparts to investigate Thai traffickers and victims abroad, and foreign nationals involved in trafficking in Thailand. The anti-money laundering office seized assets worth more than 31 million baht ($950,920) from suspected traffickers in 2017, including in cases involving forced labor on fishing vessels, compared to 784 million baht ($24 million) seized in 2016. The government amended the Human Trafficking Criminal Procedures Act to allow judges to award compensation or restitution to victims, including in the absence of a victim request for these funds. In early 2018, the Royal Thai Police (RTP) established the Thailand Anti-Trafficking in Persons Task Force (TATIP), composed of law enforcement, social workers, and NGOs, to increase coordination of sex and labor trafficking law enforcement efforts. TATIP included teams of first responders dedicated to screening potential victims, gathering evidence, conducting operations, interrogating subjects, and analyzing digital evidence. The RTP increased the number of personnel assigned to the Thai Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force (TICAC), which investigated internet-facilitated child sex trafficking. In 2017, TICAC investigated 41 allegations of online child exploitation (24 in 2016), including 18 trafficking cases (four in 2016) which resulted in eight trafficking prosecutions. The government operated specialized anti-trafficking divisions within the Bangkok Criminal Court, office of the attorney general (OAG), and the RTP. The government made efforts to encourage victim and witness participation in trafficking investigations and prosecutions. Some victims continued to report reluctance to participate in prosecutions due to fear of detention, an inadequate understanding of the Thai legal process, language barriers, and preferring repatriation over lengthy shelter stays and judicial processes. The specialized anti-trafficking law enforcement divisions continued to complete trafficking investigations and prosecutions more quickly than in previous reporting periods; courts completed the majority of cases heard in 2017 within six months. Thai courts increasingly admitted advance and video testimony by victims as evidence in trials, increasing the willingness of victims to act as witnesses. Prosecutors also worked with NGOs to prepare victims to provide testimony. The government provided 4.3 million baht ($130,670) for witness protection services for 52 witnesses in trafficking cases in 2017, compared to 2.9 million baht ($88,960) for 254 witnesses in 2016. The government-funded trainings focused on anti-trafficking laws for more than 2,600 police, prosecutors, and other law enforcement officials. The government completed a manual outlining standard operating procedures (SOPs) for trafficking investigations and initiated a pilot in one region in early 2018 to test the procedures; the pilot was ongoing at the end of the reporting period. In addition, the government held training sessions with judges and prosecutors in two local regions to increase their coordination in trafficking cases. In an effort to improve the quality of trafficking prosecutions across the country, the government operated a sub-unit within the OAG trafficking division to provide guidance and mentoring for provincial law enforcement, prosecutors, and other court officials. Coordination between local law enforcement and prosecutors improved, but in some cases weak coordination impeded the success of trafficking prosecutions during the reporting period. The government required all judicial branch officials to report all trafficking-related cases into an integrated case database. The Department of Labor Protection and Welfare (DLPW) organized training for 335 law enforcement officers on forced labor, emphasizing non-physical indicators of trafficking. However, in some cases, first responders, prosecutors, and judges did not sufficiently examine evidence or properly interpret trafficking laws, especially for labor trafficking. ","protection":"The government increased efforts to protect victims but identified significantly fewer trafficking victims, particularly of labor trafficking, than in the previous reporting period. The government identified 455 victims in 2017 (824 in 2016), including 336 sex trafficking victims (335 in 2016) and 119 labor trafficking victims (489 in 2016). NGOs and trafficking experts expressed concern that the government inconsistently identified trafficking victims, leaving them vulnerable to penalization and re-trafficking. The Ministry of Social Development and Human Security (MSDHS) reported assisting 450 victims in government shelters (561 in 2016), including 360 identified in 2017 and 90 identified in 2016, of which 132 were Thai and 228 were foreign victims. Authorities assisted in repatriating 147 foreign victims exploited in Thailand, including 36 Rohingya, and facilitated the return of 45 Thais exploited abroad by providing funding 416THAILANDfor travel expenses, legal assistance, job placement, and other reintegration services. Government agencies participating in multidisciplinary teams who deployed to screen for indications of trafficking among vulnerable populations used a standard questionnaire to guide interviews with potential victims. Some NGOs asserted multidisciplinary teams improved capacity to identify victims using a victim-centered approach and were effective in some regions during the reporting period; however, effective implementation of identification procedures was less consistent outside urban areas. Some officials failed to recognize non-physical indicators of trafficking, such as non-payment of wages and document confiscation. In addition to trainings for law enforcement, the government trained more than 1,400 multidisciplinary team members, labor inspectors, social workers, and interpreters on victim identification and referral systems. The government held a series of workshops in early 2018 to review and update screening questions, procedures, and investigative techniques to improve the success of prosecutions. In addition, the RTP established a working group with the MOL to review and evaluate labor violations such as wage disputes and child labor to identify potential victims of trafficking. The government also created a victim specialist training program in early 2018 with 50 social workers, NGO personnel, TATIP members, and other officials to improve identification and investigative techniques. Participants were appointed to mobile response teams that will advise multidisciplinary teams in complex cases. MSDHS trained and registered 67 additional interpreters in 2017, bringing the total number of available interpreters to 251. In addition, the government employed 60 Burmese and Cambodian language coordinators for port-in-port-out (PIPO) inspection centers, an increase from 30 in 2016, and MOL employed 74 interpreters. MOL held trainings for language coordinators onboard vessels and MSDHS held five training sessions on victim assistance for interpreters to support the Command Center for Combatting Illegal Fishing (CCCIF) and the anti-trafficking units of the OAG, police, and criminal courts. The government continued to refer victims to the 76 short-stay shelters or the nine long-term regional trafficking shelters operated by MSDHS, where they had access to counseling, legal assistance, medical care, civil compensation, financial aid, witness protection, education or vocational trainings, and employment. The government offered Thai victims who did not request assistance in shelters with legal assistance and compensation from the anti-trafficking fund. Gaps in access to suitable services and treatment during investigations, such as subjecting victims to multiple interviews, threat of detention or deportations, lengthy trials, and a lack of shelters in parts of the country, deterred victims from approaching authorities. NGOs reported concerns over the lack of appropriate options for foreign children whose families were complicit in their trafficking or whose identities could not be established. Authorities were more likely to send boy victims to juvenile detention facilities than to centers offering victim services. In October 2017, the government issued regulations to provide for government oversight of NGO shelters while making available the technical support of MSDHS and the opportunity for NGOs to apply for funds from the MSDHS anti-trafficking fund. Previously, NGOs could operate shelters for trafficking victims without government financial support or oversight. The government continued to operate three child advocacy centers in Chiang Mai, Pattaya, and Phuket which served as child-friendly spaces in which law enforcement, NGOs, and social workers could conduct forensic interviews of child trafficking victims. The government continued to allow more adult trafficking victims the ability to travel, work, and reside outside shelters as provided by Thailand's anti-trafficking law. Of the 450 victims in government shelters, 287 were employed either inside or outside shelters during the course of legal proceedings. Others were in the recovery period, chose not to work, were too young to work, or were receiving educational training in shelters. MSDHS approved a daily allowance of 300 baht ($9.20)\u0160which was the minimum wage in most parts of Thailand\u0160to victims residing in MSDHS shelters who wished to work but were unable to do so due to security concerns or were awaiting an employment opportunity, as well as to some victims not residing in MSDHS shelters who intend to work; however, at the end of 2017, only 24 victims were receiving this financial support. Government efforts to more quickly complete trafficking prosecutions may have resulted in victims spending less time in shelters. NGOs reported a decline in the prevalence of child begging following the passage of the Beggar Control Act during the previous reporting period, which provided for health and social services to beggars, including trafficking victims. The government identified 35 victims of forced begging in 2017, an increase from 20 identified in 2016. However, government agencies inconsistently enforced laws related to forced begging, which may have resulted in authorities sending some potential child victims to homeless shelters rather than MSDHS trafficking shelters. In 2017, the government provided more than 10.2 million baht ($314,110) to victims and witnesses through various government funds, compared to 9.2 million baht ($280,980) in 2016. This included 5.6 million baht ($171,780) provided to 760 victims from its anti-trafficking fund (5.8 million baht ($177,910) to 648 victims in 2016). In addition, courts ordered more than 18.4 million baht ($565,640) in restitution from traffickers to 151 victims in 2017, an increase from 1.7 million baht ($50,610) to 15 victims in 2016. Nonetheless, legal advocates and NGOs reported compensation and restitution for victims were inconsistently paid and remained too low to incentivize victims to cooperate in prosecutions and funds seized from traffickers' assets were not awarded to victims. MSDHS established a sub-unit under its anti-trafficking division to provide victims legal assistance and file compensation claims. The government provided legal alternatives to deportation to victims who faced retribution or hardship upon return to their home countries. It permitted foreign trafficking victims and witnesses to stay and work in Thailand for up to two years; however, since the government approved extending the duration of stay from one year to two in early 2017, it granted only one victim this status. The law protected victims from prosecution for acts committed as a result of being subjected to trafficking; however, ftaws in the government's implementation of victim identification procedures and its efforts to arrest and deport immigration violators increased victims' risk of being re-victimized and treated as criminals. Victims were prosecuted for crimes committed as a direct result of being subjected to trafficking, including prostitution and immigration violations. The government's criminal defamation laws allowed companies to pursue criminal charges against potential victims during the reporting period; additionally, labor inspectors could be held personally liable for claims of abuse of power, which could be misused and limit their ability or willingness to perform their work. Such policies may have prevented victims, advocates, and labor inspectors from feeling empowered to report abuse. The government amended the anti-trafficking law in 2015 to provide protection to whistleblowers but did not report whether this new provision had been applied.417THAILAND","recommendation":"Improve the capacity of law enforcement, labor inspectors, and first responders to consistently and proactively screen for and identify victims among vulnerable populations, including migrant workers, stateless persons, children, and refugees, and to ensure victims are not subjected to arrest, detainment, or deportations for crimes committed as a direct result of being subjected to trafficking; proactively investigate and prosecute officials allegedly complicit in trafficking, and convict and punish those found guilty with dissuasive sentences; improve the capacity of law enforcement to proactively prosecute and convict sex and labor traffickers; improve law enforcement and first responders' ability to identify and prosecute cases of forced labor, especially in cases lacking physical coercion or confinement; continue to train multidisciplinary teams and labor inspectors to improve the quality of fishing vessel inspections that could result in the identification of victims and criminal investigations; ensure government and NGO-run shelters provide victims with adequate trauma-informed care, including legal assistance, and increase the provision of financial compensation and restitution to victims, including to those who are unable to work outside shelters; foster an environment conducive to reporting human trafficking crimes without fear of criminal prosecution and provide protections for multidisciplinary teams against interference or retaliation; regulate migrant worker labor recruiters, including by enforcing bans on worker-paid recruitment fees and by prosecuting cases with indicators of trafficking; improve migrant workers' rights, legal status, and labor migration policies to minimize the risk of trafficking; enforce regular payment of wages and the rights of employees to retain possession of their own identity and financial documents; and proactively inform migrant workers and other vulnerable populations of their rights, including under new migrant worker regulations, and legal protections from human trafficking.","tier":"TIER 2","traffick_profile":"As reported over the past five years, Thailand is a source, destination, and transit country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking. Labor trafficking victims are exploited in commercial fishing and related industries, the poultry industry, manufacturing, agriculture, and domestic work, or forced into street begging. Thailand's commercial sex industry remains vast, increasing vulnerabilities for sex trafficking. Women, men, boys, and girls from Thailand, other Southeast Asian countries, Sri Lanka, Russia, Uzbekistan, and some African countries are subjected to labor and sex trafficking in Thailand. Thailand is also a transit country for victims from China, North Korea, Vietnam, Bangladesh, India, and Burma subjected to sex trafficking and forced labor in countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Russia, South Korea, the United States, and countries in Western Europe. Thai nationals are subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking in Thailand and in countries in North America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. Members of ethnic minorities, highland persons, and stateless persons in Thailand have experienced instances of abuse indicative of trafficking. Children from Thailand, Burma, Laos, and Cambodia are victims of sex trafficking in brothels, massage parlors, bars, karaoke lounges, hotels, and private residences. Children in orphanages are vulnerable to exploitation, including trafficking. Some parents or brokers force children from Thailand, Cambodia and Burma to sell ftowers, beg, or work in domestic service in urban areas. As recently as 2015, there were reports of separatist groups in southern Thailand recruiting and using children to commit acts of arson or serve as scouts. Instances of trafficking, migrant smuggling, abduction, and extortion of migrants occur as migrants move between Thailand and neighboring countries. Traffickers, including some registered and unregistered labor brokers of Thai and foreign nationalities, bring foreign victims into Thailand through both formal migration and smuggling routes and serve as intermediaries between job-seekers and employers. Some brokers charge substantial fees or collaborate with corrupt law enforcement officials, and some Thai and migrant workers incur significant debts to obtain employment and are subjected to debt bondage. There are reports that some brokers and employers continue to confiscate identity documents. Thai men and women who migrate overseas also rely on registered and unregistered labor brokers to facilitate acquisition of low-skilled contract work or agricultural labor and are sometimes subjected to conditions of forced labor and debt bondage. Trafficking in the fishing industry remains a significant concern. Thai, Burmese, Cambodian, Vietnamese, and Indonesian men and boys are subject to forced labor on Thai and foreign-owned fishing boats. Some remain at sea for several years, are paid very little or irregularly, work as much as 18 to 20 hours per day for seven days a week, and are reportedly threatened, physically beaten, drugged to work longer, and even killed for becoming ill, attempting to escape, or disobeying orders. Some trafficking victims in the fishing sector had difficulty returning home due to isolated workplaces, unpaid wages, and the lack of legitimate identity documents or safe means to travel.Corruption continues to undermine anti-trafficking efforts. Some government officials are directly complicit in trafficking crimes, including through accepting bribes or loans from business owners and brothels where victims are exploited. Credible reports indicate some corrupt officials protect brothels and other commercial sex venues from raids and inspections and collude with traffickers. Migrant workers, especially those who are undocumented, are fearful of reporting trafficking crimes and cooperating with authorities due to lack of awareness of their rights and minimal protections both in Thailand and in countries of origin and a general fear of authority that may stem from their country of origin or their experience in Thailand. Some government officials profit from bribes and direct involvement in the extortion and exploitation of migrants. Some of these migrants are kidnapped and held for ransom, which increases their vulnerability to sexual servitude, forced labor, or debt bondage."},"Togo":{"April":0.0,"Asylum Seekers":"4","August":0.0,"December":0.0,"February":0.0,"Friday":0.0,"Global Population":7889.09,"January":0.0,"July":0.0,"June":0.0,"Life Expectancy":60.76,"March":0.0,"May":0.0,"Monday":1.0,"November":0.0,"October":1.0,"Population below $1.90 a day":"49.8","Saturday":0.0,"September":0.0,"Sunday":0.0,"Thursday":0.0,"Tuesday":0.0,"Violence against civilians":1,"Wednesday":0.0,"fatalities":["0"],"government_effort":"NA","introduction":"The Government of Togo does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so.

The government coordinated its counter-child trafficking efforts and dissemination of information through MSA's Anti-Trafficking in Persons Cell, previously the National Committee for the Reception and Social Reinsertion of Trafficked Children. The Anti-Trafficking in Persons Cell convened frequently during the year, and acted as a central hub of information and tracked statistics on trafficking of children in Togo, including the repatriation of child victims; however, data collection and reporting remained weak during the reporting period and the government had not updated its anti-trafficking national action plan since 2008. The government employed a network of vigilance committees in nearly every village in the country to provide education on trafficking and report cases to the government, although the effectiveness of these committees varied greatly. The government did not report efforts to raise public awareness of trafficking.During the reporting period, the Ministry of Grassroots Development partnered with an international organization to launch a microfinance enterprise that provided 5,000 FCFA ($8.89) per month to families with children via a mobile phone payment. Togo is a low-income country, and the government designed this program to alleviate the economic conditions that motivate many internal cases of child trafficking, and reached nearly 30,000 families in 2017. The government plans to increase the reach of the program to 120,000 over the next three years.The government employed 191 labor inspectors across all five regions during the reporting period, an increase from 167 inspectors from the previous year. Despite the increase, there were still too few inspectors compared to the scale of child labor in the country, much of which could constitute trafficking, according to Togo's law. An NGO reported inspectors often did not address obvious cases of child labor in large, open-air markets in urban centers. During the reporting period, the government identified 66 children in child labor, including potential trafficking victims, compared with 246 in 2016. The government did not regulate foreign labor recruiters. The government worked to reduce the demand for forced labor through the continuation of a program partnering with 30 traditional religious leaders to eliminate exploitation through the practice of religious \ufb01apprenticeships\ufb02\u0160a practice in which children are entrusted to religious leaders who exploit them in forced domestic work, or, in some cases, sexual slavery when parents are unable to pay school fees. The government distributed birth certificates with the assistance of NGOs; the lack of identification documents increased vulnerability to trafficking in persons. During the reporting period, the government coordinated with the Economic Community of West African States and an international organization to synchronize regional and country-level anti-trafficking national action plans through the Free Movement of Persons & Migration program, which included a component focused on populations vulnerable to human trafficking. Officials continued to cooperate in regional anti-trafficking coordination and planning efforts with Benin, Ghana, and Nigeria on border control efforts and with the West African Multilateral Accord and the Multilateral Cooperation Agreement to Combat Trafficking in Persons in West and Central 422TONGAAfrica. The government did not take any discernible measures to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts. The government provided anti-trafficking training to Togolese troops prior to their deployment abroad on international peacekeeping missions. The government did not provide anti-trafficking training for its diplomatic personnel.","prosecution":"The government decreased law enforcement efforts. Articles 317 through 320 of the penal code, revised in 2015, criminalized sex and labor trafficking and prescribed penalties of 10 to 20 years imprisonment and fines between 10 million and 50 million West African CFA franc (FCFA) ($17,780 and $88,920); these penalties were sufficiently stringent, and with regard to sex trafficking, commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. The government reported investigating and prosecuting eight cases involving eight alleged traffickers. Authorities convicted seven of the eight suspects under articles 317 through 320 in the revised penal code in 2017, compared with 101 investigations and 60 convictions of traffickers in 2016. The government did not report any investigations, prosecutions, or convictions of 421TOGOgovernment officials complicit in human trafficking offenses. Experts reported judges were often reluctant to convict or fine parents who subjected their children to trafficking, as they felt it would exacerbate the economic situation that drove a parent to commit the crime. NGOs reported that the 2015 revised penal code's more stringent penalties aggravated these concerns amongst law enforcement officials and judges, and may have led to decreased arrests and prosecutions for trafficking crimes. The government provided written instruction materials on victim identification to its law enforcement and immigration officials through the course of their basic training. The government cooperated with the Governments of Benin, Ghana, and Nigeria under a joint agreement on the control and monitoring of borders to prevent child trafficking, repatriate victims, and extradite traffickers. Additionally, the government cooperated with all west African states under the West African Multilateral Accord and with all west and central African states under the Multilateral Cooperation Agreement to Combat Trafficking in Persons in West and Central Africa. These partnerships resulted in increased regional anti-trafficking coordination and planning efforts.","protection":"The government marginally increased protection efforts. In 2017, authorities identified 126 victims of trafficking, compared to 99 child victims identified during the previous reporting period. For the first time in over five years, law enforcement officials identified four adult victims. The government did not compile comprehensive victim identification and protection statistics, and did not report the number of victims referred to care facilities or provided assistance. The government remained without SOPs for use by officials in the identification and referral of trafficking victims, including both adults and children, and those victimized within Togo. For the first time, the government provided victim identification training to law enforcement and immigration officials. In Lome, the Ministry of Social Affairs (MSA) continued to run a toll-free 24-hour helpline, Allo 10-11, which received more than 50,000 calls in 2017 regarding child trafficking and other forms of child abuse. The National Committee for the Reception and Social Reinsertion of Trafficked Children, Togo's national anti-trafficking committee comprising government officials and NGOs, continued to operate jointly with the police an ad hoc referral system to respond to hotline tips. The government reported limited direct provision of services to victims during the reporting period. The government assisted in the repatriation of, and provided services for, transnational child trafficking victims. The government provided these victims with health services, food, and lodging during their reintegration and reunited them with their families. MSA continued to operate two shelters; the Tokoin Community Center served as an intermediary shelter for child victims before transfer to care facilities managed by NGOs, while another shelter, CROPESDI, provided shelter, legal, medical, and social services to child victims up to age 14. The government did not report whether these shelters assisted child trafficking victims during the reporting period or provide details on its budget for victim assistance and protection. The government did not offer temporary or permanent residency status to foreign victims facing hardship or retribution upon return to their countries of origin. The government did not have a formal process to encourage victims' participation in the investigation and prosecution of their traffickers, and it is unclear whether any victims did so during the reporting period. There were no reports of child victims being penalized for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being subjected to trafficking.","recommendation":"Increase efforts to prosecute, convict, and punish traffickers, especially those involved in the trafficking of adults and forced labor of children using the amended penal code; develop and implement standard operating procedures (SOPs) for law enforcement officers, immigration officials, social welfare personnel, as well as labor inspectors to identify and refer trafficking victims, including both adults and children and those victimized within Togo; develop a system among law enforcement and judicial officials to track and report on human trafficking investigations and prosecutions, as well as victim assistance; enact anti-trafficking legislation that includes provisions for victim protection; develop and implement a national action plan that incorporates adult victims, and increases coordination with NGOs and regional organizations; and increase efforts to raise public awareness about the dangers of human trafficking, including the trafficking of adults.","tier":"TIER 2 WATCH LIST","traffick_profile":"As reported over the past five years, Togo is a source, transit and, to a lesser extent, destination country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking. The western border of the Plateau region, which provides easy access to major roads leading to Lome, and Accra, Ghana, was a primary source for trafficking victims during the reporting period. Most Togolese victims are children exploited within the country due to high levels of poverty. Forced child labor occurs in the agricultural sector\u0160particularly on coffee, cocoa, and cotton farms\u0160as well as in stone and sand quarries, where children and adults break rocks by hand. Traffickers bring children from rural areas in the north and central regions to Lome, where they are subjected to forced labor as domestic servants, roadside vendors, and porters, or exploited in child sex trafficking. Boys are subjected to forced labor in construction, in salvage yards and mines, and as mechanics, often working with hazardous machinery. Children from Benin and Ghana are recruited and transported to Togo for forced labor. Girls from Ghana are exploited in sex trafficking in Togo. Togolese boys and girls are transported to Benin, Cote d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Ghana, and Nigeria and forced to work in the agricultural sector. From September to April, many Togolese adults and children migrate in search of economic opportunities to Benin, Burkina Faso, Niger, and Mali, where many are subjected to labor and sex trafficking. In Nigeria, Togolese men are subjected to forced labor in agriculture and Togolese women are exploited in domestic servitude. Togolese women have been fraudulently recruited for employment in Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, the United States, and Europe, where they are subjected to domestic servitude or forced prostitution.

The MOJ-led and -funded national anti-trafficking commission, which included representatives from 12 ministries and experts from civil society, met several times during the reporting period. In January 2018, the minister of justice inaugurated the permanent headquarters of the national commission and announced his strong support for its work. During the reporting period, the government implemented its 2015-2017 national anti-trafficking action plan by developing several manuals and training guides for judges and security personnel, and it also continued to develop its 2018-2023 national strategy to combat trafficking. In January 2018, the government began operating a hotline to report potential trafficking cases, which was operational five days a week during regular business hours and operators spoke Arabic, French, and English. During its first week of operation, the hotline received 34 calls reporting potential cases of trafficking. Throughout the reporting period, the government conducted numerous anti-trafficking public awareness and information campaigns, at times in partnership with civil society organizations, and it also conducted awareness raising trainings for child welfare workers, social workers, psychologists, and civil society representatives. Additionally, during the reporting period, the MOI placed announcements on social media sites and newspapers to inform the public about fraudulent work contracts and forced labor. The government reported efforts to reduce the demand for forced labor. The labor inspectorate at the MSA designated 25 labor inspectors and 24 social workers trained as specialized points of contact for child trafficking victims. To address fraudulent labor recruitment practices, the Agency for Placement Abroad in Private Establishments (EPPA), a governmental agency, filed complaints with the MOI against 17 private employers for cases of fraud, extortion, or unauthorized abuses of Tunisians employed abroad; it also took action against 30 private employers who recruited workers without proper registration with the EPPA. This demonstrated a slight increase from actions the government took against fraudulent recruitment practices 427TURKEYin the previous reporting period. In July 2017, the government signed a memorandum of understanding with the ILO and the largest Tunisian labor and employers' unions to promote decent work in Tunisia for 2017-2022. In September 2017, the MSA collaborated with the National Institute of Statistics, a governmental agency, to conduct a national study on child labor in Tunisia. The government maintained bilateral labor migration agreements with France and Switzerland, which contained provisions to prevent unfair labor recruitment practices and labor trafficking. During the reporting period, the government finalized a national strategy for migration, which addresses the rights of foreign migrants and Tunisian migrants abroad, and includes provisions to prevent forced labor. The government took some efforts to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts; it continued efforts over the last few years to cooperate with civil society organizations to reintegrate into the formal economy women who were formerly in prostitution in brothels. ","prosecution":"The government increased its law enforcement efforts to combat trafficking during the reporting period. Tunisia's anti-trafficking law, Organic Law 2016-61, enacted in July 2016, criminalized sex and labor trafficking and prescribed penalties of 10 years imprisonment and a fine of 50,000 Tunisian dinar (TND) ($20,340) for offenses involving adult victims and 15 years imprisonment and a fine of 50,000-100,000 TND ($20,340-$40,680) for those involving child victims. These penalties were sufficiently stringent and, with respect to sex trafficking, commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious crimes, such as kidnapping. From April 2017 to January 2018, the Ministry of Interior (MOI) conducted 28 initial investigations of potential forced labor crimes and 57 potential crimes of sexual exploitation. Of these investigations, police arrested four individuals for allegedly forcing three women aged 18 to 19 into prostitution. Additionally, the Ministry of Women, Family, and Childhood (MWFC) identified 373 potential cases of child trafficking after receiving reported cases of child endangerment. As of March 2018, the MOI reported the opening of judicial investigations into 195 traffickers for forced prostitution, forced labor, and forced begging under the anti-trafficking law. The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) reported it brought 21 perpetrators to trial under the anti-trafficking law. The government convicted one female perpetrator for forced begging under the anti-trafficking law and sentenced her to one month imprisonment; however, the case remained pending at the end of the reporting period, as she absconded from authorities before serving her sentence and remained at-large. In 2017, the government reported only data that it prosecuted and convicted under the anti-trafficking law, due to the government's efforts to fully implement the law and train judicial and law enforcement officers. In comparison, in 2016, the government had not implemented the anti-trafficking law and reported prosecutions and convictions of crimes under other articles of the penal code, some of which were not trafficking crimes. Nevertheless, during the reporting period, officials reported difficulty prosecuting and convicting trafficking offenders due to lack of victim or witness testimony. The government did not report any investigations, prosecutions, or convictions of government officials complicit in human trafficking offenses. During the reporting period, the MOJ designated a deputy prosecutor and investigative judge for each tribunal throughout the country, who were responsible for overseeing human trafficking cases and leading anti-trafficking training programs for judicial officials. In February 2018, the government, in partnership with an international organization, provided training for 24 judges who were chosen to be the trafficking experts and primary points of contact within these tribunals. In October 2017, the MOJ also created an office to monitor and maintain statistics on human trafficking cases brought before the judiciary; this office also had the authority to conduct research on the application of the anti-trafficking law and advise the minister of justice on policies related to the implementation of the law. Throughout the reporting period, the government conducted multiple training programs for security personnel and other government officials on the anti-trafficking law, victim identification techniques, and protection services. The government also continued international cooperation with INTERPOL offices in the region to improve informational exchanges about potential trafficking cases. ","protection":"The government increased efforts to identify and refer trafficking victims to care. The government lacked formal 426TUNISIAvictim identification procedures, but it continued to work in cooperation with civil society groups to train key law enforcement, judicial, immigration, and social services personnel to identify victims among high-risk populations. In 2017, the Ministry of Social Affairs (MSA) continued to cooperate with two NGOs through signed agreements to assist those at risk of abuse and exploitation, including trafficking victims. Between April 2017 and January 2018, the MOI reported it identified 285 trafficking victims, including victims of sex trafficking, domestic servitude, and forced begging, as well as child victims of sexual exploitation, forced labor, and exploitation in organized crime. This demonstrated an increase in identified victims compared to the previous reporting period when the MOI identified 134 victims. Additionally, child protection specialists from MWFC identified 373 potential trafficking victims among the more than 12,000 child welfare cases they received in 2017; these cases included potential child victims of sexual exploitation, exploitation in organized crimes, and forced labor. The Ministry of Health (MOH) also identified 29 potential trafficking victims of sexual and economic exploitation and forced begging, including three foreign nationals and nine children, among patients that received services from the MOH. According to an international organization in early 2018, since the implementation of the anti-trafficking law, victims and witnesses of trafficking crimes were reportedly more willing to come forward to the authorities and seek assistance. The government referred all 285 identified victims to protection services provided by both government entities and civil society organizations. Specifically, the MSA provided assistance and accommodation, including lodging and medical and psychological assistance, to 52 foreign and Tunisian victims of forced labor and sexual exploitation. The MOI facilitated the provision of medical services for 10 of the victims it identified, while it also provided social assistance and accommodation to seven foreign victims and 25 Tunisian child victims. The MSA continued to operate centers for vulnerable populations, including victims of trafficking, domestic violence and sexual assault, asylum-seekers, unaccompanied minors, and the homeless. Through these shelters, the government provided vulnerable groups, including trafficking victims, with lodging, food, clothing, full and free medical care, psychological services, and legal aid through a network of pro bono lawyers. Three of these centers in Tunis, Sousse, and Sfax had designated areas available for victims of all forms of trafficking. The center in Tunis held a dedicated office for male and female trafficking victims with a trained social worker and offered medical and psychological exams. This center also allowed foreign embassies access to their nationals to provide assistance, including provision of legal documents and repatriation services. In October and November 2017, the MSA\u0160in collaboration with an international organization\u0160provided training for shelter staff on rehabilitation and care for trafficking victims. The MSA also organized a workshop for 40 participants, including the staff from both the Sousse and Sfax shelters and civil society representatives, to build partnerships for victim assistance. An MOH-operated hospital in Tunis had a unit dedicated to caring for victims of violence and sexual violence, including victims of sexual exploitation, which offered psycho-social support, medical documentation, and legal expertise. Since 2015, personnel in this unit continued to receive trafficking victim identification training and the unit assisted some trafficking victims in 2017. Despite the government's efforts to identify, refer, and provide protection services to victims, during the reporting period, the government did not formally adopt a mechanism for the referral of trafficking victims to government-operated social centers or NGO-run shelters; however, in early 2017 the MOI adopted its own internal procedures to identify and refer victims by cooperating with civil society organizations and other government ministries. Due to a lack of systematic victim identification and referral procedures and policies, some unidentified victims may have been punished for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being subjected to human trafficking, such as women in prostitution or illegal immigrants.The government offered foreign trafficking victims legal alternatives to their removal to countries where they might face hardship or retribution; in 2017, the government granted one victim a temporary residency permit as an alternative to returning home. Trafficking victims could seek legal employment while under temporary residency status. During the reporting period, the government assisted 10 foreign trafficking victims (who were referred by an international organization) to obtain an exemption from paying overstay fees in order to leave the country. During the reporting period, the government reportedly offered all foreign trafficking victims relief from deportation and, for those who chose to return home, repatriation services. Under the anti-trafficking law, victims had the right to free legal aid to assist them in engaging in civil and criminal proceedings against their traffickers, and the government provided psychological and physical protection services to victims and witnesses of trafficking crimes. ","recommendation":"Implement formal procedures to screen and proactively identify trafficking victims\u0160particularly among vulnerable groups such as domestic workers, persons in prostitution, undocumented migrants, and street children\u0160and train officials on their use; adopt and fully implement the national victim referral mechanism to ensure all trafficking victims are referred to appropriate protection services and train law enforcement and judicial authorities on appropriately referring victims to care; develop procedures to ensure victims are not punished for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being subjected to trafficking, such as prostitution and immigration violations; use the anti-trafficking law to investigate, prosecute, and convict traffickers with stringent sentences and train judicial and law enforcement officials on the law; provide adequate protection services to all trafficking victims, including appropriate shelter and rehabilitative services tailored to trafficking victims; provide funding or in-kind support to NGOs that provide care to trafficking victims; and train staff at government-operated centers for vulnerable populations to provide trafficking victims with specialized care.","tier":"TIER 2","traffick_profile":"As reported over the past five years, Tunisia is a source, destination, and possible transit country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking. In 2017, the government observed an increase in child victims of sexual violence and exploitation, some of whom are victims of trafficking. According to a baseline study published in 2013, conducted by the Tunisian government and an international organization, Tunisian youth are subjected to various forms of trafficking. According to the study and as reported by other experts since 2016, some Tunisian girls work as domestic servants for wealthy families in Tunis and major coastal cities; they are highly vulnerable to trafficking, experiencing restrictions on movement, physical and psychological violence, and sexual abuse. International organizations report a continued presence of street children selling goods on street corners and rural children working in agriculture to support their families in Tunisia; these children are vulnerable to forced labor or sex trafficking. Tunisian security officials report that organized gangs force street children to serve as thieves and beggars and transport drugs. According to experts, in 2017 Tunisian children\u0160many of whom have dropped out of school and are between the ages of 11 and 12 years old\u0160are observed working in small workshops, auto mechanic garages, and domestic work; some of these children may be vulnerable to trafficking. Tunisian women have reportedly been forced into prostitution under false promises of work both within the country and elsewhere in the region, such as Lebanon, United Arab Emirates, and Jordan. Foreign migrants are particularly vulnerable to sexual exploitation, domestic servitude, and other forms of forced labor in Tunisia. According to an NGO in 2017, foreign trafficking victims typically arrive in Tunisia on a valid tourist or student visa and remain in an exploitative situation for an average of five to 13 months, surpassing the validity of their visa. Civil society and international organizations continue to report an increase in women, primarily from West Africa and increasingly from Cote d'Ivoire, who are exploited in domestic servitude in private homes in Tunis, Sfax, Sousse, and Gabes. An NGO reported in 2017 that recruiters in Cote d'Ivoire target both well-educated and non-skilled individuals in the country with false and fraudulent promises of work in Tunisia. Well-educated Ivoirians, who pay a recruiter to assist them to find work in Tunisia, are promised jobs that do not exist upon arrival in Tunisia, held in debt bondage, and forced into domestic servitude in Tunisian households. Recruiters also target unskilled and uneducated individuals primarily from San Pedro, Cote d'Ivoire, to work in domestic work or agriculture in Tunisia; these individuals are then required to repay the transportation costs and recruitment fees upon arrival and thereby held in debt bondage by their employers. NGOs and international organizations observed in 2017 a slight increase in boys from Sub-Saharan and West Africa, including boys from Cote d'Ivoire, who are vulnerable to trafficking after accepting fraudulent offers of soccer careers in Tunisia. Migrants fteeing unrest in neighboring countries continue to be vulnerable to trafficking in Tunisia."},"Turkey":{"April":1.0,"Asylum Seekers":"34","August":0.0,"December":19.0,"February":0.0,"Friday":20.0,"Global Population":82340.09,"January":0.0,"July":5.0,"June":7.0,"Life Expectancy":77.44,"March":3.0,"May":6.0,"Monday":5.0,"November":15.0,"October":12.0,"Population below $1.90 a day":"0.2","Saturday":6.0,"September":16.0,"Sunday":9.0,"Thursday":17.0,"Tuesday":17.0,"Violence against civilians":84,"Wednesday":10.0,"fatalities":["0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","2","0","0","0","0","2","0","0","0","1","0","0","2","1","1","0","0","0","0","4","0","0","0","0","0","1","1","1","1","1","4"],"government_effort":"NA","introduction":"The Government of Turkey does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. The government demonstrated increasing efforts compared to the previous reporting period; therefore Turkey remained on Tier 2. The government demonstrated increasing efforts by identifying more victims and referring them to assistance. The government adopted multiple regulations that improved victim-centered prosecutions, and increased the staff of the Directorate General of Migration Management, the lead agency on combating trafficking. The government also continued cooperation with international organizations to train first responders, judges, and prosecutors. However, the government did not meet the minimum standards in several key areas. Some first responders lacked an understanding of trafficking, and there were reports of inconsistent victim identification which may have resulted in the detention and deportation of victims. Interagency coordination remained problematic, and law enforcement and judicial resources were strained as a result of dismissals of personnel under the state of emergency following the July 2016 coup attempt. Civil society remained largely excluded from anti-trafficking efforts, and specialized support services for victims were limited to a government-run shelter after several NGO-run shelters closed in 2016; critics asserted civil society's diminishing role hindered the identification and specialized care of victims.

The government drafted a national action plan but had not adopted it at the end of the reporting period. A senior-level national committee to coordinate interagency anti-trafficking efforts convened in March 2017 and February 2018. DGMM assumed the management of a national hotline that also handled trafficking calls from an international organization and trained new employees on trafficking issues, although observers reported a decrease in capacity to handle trafficking cases, possibly due to budget shortfalls to maintain the hotline. The government continued to prepare and distribute brochures on trafficking in six languages. DGMM issued its first annual report on trafficking and continued to publish annual data reports on its website for 2013-2017; however, observers reported the government did not share detailed statistics on a regular basis and OSCE reported discrepancies in the statistics of the different databases managed by various state institutions, such as the Ministry of Interior, MOJ, and courts. DGMM organized a workshop on anti-trafficking and hosted a meeting with national journalists to explain Turkey's efforts to combat trafficking. The government continued to implement comprehensive migrant registration protocols by registering more than three million Syrians and providing birth registrations for newly-born refugee children and reported efforts to naturalize approximately 50,000 Syrian refugees under temporary protection. Many observers reported the country's approximately 1,000 labor inspectors remained insufficient to monitor and inspect for child labor. Government efforts to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts or forced labor remained uneven. The government did not provide anti-trafficking training to diplomatic personnel.","prosecution":"The government maintained law enforcement efforts. Article 80 of the penal code criminalized sex and labor trafficking and prescribed penalties of up to eight to 12 years imprisonment, which were sufficiently stringent and, with respect to sex trafficking, commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) prosecuted 41 new trafficking-related cases with 291 defendants in the first three quarters of 2017 (53 new cases with 257 defendants in the first three quarters of 2016). MOJ continued to prosecute 174 cases with 1,624 defendants from the previous year (187 cases with 1,594 defendants in 2016). Courts convicted 44 traffickers (40 in 2016); all convicted traffickers received prison sentences and 42 traffickers also received a fine. Courts acquitted 93 suspected traffickers in the first three quarters of 2017 (272 in 2016).The Department of Combatting Migrant Smuggling and Human Trafficking (DCMH) within the Turkish National Police (TNP) conducted specialized investigations. DCMH consisted of 28 officers (50 in 2016) at headquarters and operated branches in 22 provinces. Observers reported law enforcement in some cases lacked sufficient resources to fully investigate trafficking cases involving refugees, and the OSCE reported misperceptions about trafficking among law enforcement authorities, including confusion about the distinction between trafficking and the aggravated form of encouragement of prostitution (Article 227). A lack of experience and specialization within the judiciary regarding trafficking also limited the ability and willingness to prosecute complex crimes like trafficking. The government did not report any investigations, prosecutions, or convictions of government employees complicit in trafficking. Some civil society groups remained concerned about corruption and official complicity in trafficking crimes, though authoritative evidence to corroborate or dispute these concerns remained elusive. The government, independently and in cooperation with international organizations, provided anti-trafficking training for law enforcement, coast guard, labor inspectors, social workers, and immigration officials. The government did not conduct international investigations or extradite traffickers in 2017.","protection":"The government increased victim protection efforts. The government identified 303 victims (181 in 2016); 186 were victims of sex trafficking, 52 of forced labor, and 65 of forced begging (143 were victims of sex trafficking, 30 of forced labor, and eight of forced begging in 2016); 212 were female and 91 were male (163 females and 18 males); 98 were children (29 in 2016). All were foreign victims in 2016 and 2017. Law enforcement conducted preliminary interviews and referred potential victims to the Directorate General for Migration Management (DGMM), which officially recognized victims; DGMM interviewed approximately 5,000 potential victims (1,930 in 2016) and increased staff at headquarters from nine to 15. However, DGMM staff's ability to accurately identify victims varied among provinces and, in some cases, staff were reportedly reluctant to act on cases referred by civil society groups. Some observers reported a general lack of understanding and awareness of trafficking among some first responders and a lack of attention towards internal trafficking. Experts reported problems with authorities recognizing non-physical methods of control by traffickers. In some cases, weak interagency coordination on referral procedures may have resulted in some potential victims not receiving official victim status and the government services such status affords. The Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Family and Social Policies (MOFSP) continued to deploy specialized staff to government-operated migrant and refugee camps to screen camp residents for indicators of trafficking; however, observers reported the government did not make sufficient victim identification efforts in the highly vulnerable refugee and migrant communities outside of camps, or provide sufficient protection resources to address trafficking in these communities. The law entitled equal services to all trafficking victims, including shelter, medical and psycho-social services, work options, education, translation services, temporary residency, repatriation assistance, and legal counseling. The government provided support to 151 victims (approximately 100 in 2016). The government covered funding for victims' services through various funding streams and did not make available the total amount of funding specifically allocated for anti-trafficking efforts. The government allocated 3.5 million Lira ($923,970) to international organizations for anti-trafficking and migration-related efforts; it did not provide funding to domestic NGOs. A DGMM-run shelter had the capacity to and did accommodate 20 female sex trafficking victims and provided psychological support, health care, access to legal aid, and vocational training. One hundred and two MOFSP-run shelters also provided accommodation for victims of violence, including men and children, and 32 locally-administered shelters offered general support services to trafficking victims. The DGMM-run shelter and MOFSP-run shelters required victims to have an escort to leave the shelter during their initial stay but allowed victims to leave the shelter voluntarily once security officials completed an assessment and deemed conditions safe, which generally took a few days. Government-operated Monitoring Centers for Children provided support to child victims of violence, including trafficking. DGMM reported negotiating agreements with four municipality-run shelters to provide specialized services to trafficking victims. Observers expressed significant concern about the general lack of inclusion of civil society groups in the government's victim protection efforts and the government's increasing removal of them from identifying and providing services to victims. Three NGO-run shelters that provided the majority of specialized support services to trafficking victims since 2004 closed operations in 2016 for various reasons. One NGO-run shelter chose to close due to security concerns, the second chose to close in response to funding shortfalls, and the third was closed by DGMM. The government likely deported and detained some trafficking victims due to inadequate identification efforts. Law entitled victims to a temporary residence permit for 30 days, which could be extended up to three years with the option to apply for a work permit; the government issued 145 residence permits (141 in 2016). NGOs reported significant hurdles for victims in acquiring work permission, including a requirement that victims move out of trafficking shelters to be eligible to work. DGMM reported assisting 193 victims' repatriation. The government granted DGMM the right to participate in court proceedings as 429TURKMENISTANa formal party to provide victim support efforts. Additionally, the government adopted a new regulation on \ufb01legal interview rooms,\ufb02 which allowed victims to testify in private rooms in order to reduce re-traumatization. The government did not report how many victims participated in criminal investigations or legal procedures. The law entitled victims to pursue restitution from their trafficker through civil suits and regulation entitled victims to one-time compensation but it did not define the amount or procedures to access it.","recommendation":"Vigorously investigate, prosecute, and convict traffickers, including those complicit in forced labor; establish a multi-disciplinary framework for victim identification and provide specialized care for all victims, including Turkish citizens, children, and male victims; provide stable funding for shelters and expand partnerships with NGOs, and civil society representatives to better identify victims and provide specialized victim services; increase training to first responders and staff at provincial offices of the Directorate General of Migration Management on victim identification, including recognizing the signs of non-physical methods of control used by traffickers; increase proactive victim identification efforts among vulnerable populations, such as refugees and asylum-seekers, migrants awaiting deportation, Turkish and foreign women and girls in prostitution, and children begging 428TURKEYin the streets and working in the agriculture and industrial sectors; train investigators, prosecutors, and judges on victim-centered approaches to trafficking cases, including advanced training on trafficking investigations and prosecutions; allocate adequate staff and resources for law enforcement to effectively combat trafficking; improve interagency cooperation and adopt a national action plan; and make trafficking-related data, especially disaggregated statistics on victims and prosecution and convictions of perpetrators, available to the public on a regular basis. ","tier":"TIER 2","traffick_profile":"As reported over the past five years, Turkey is a destination and transit country and, to a lesser extent, a source country for women, men, and children subjected to sex trafficking and forced labor. Trafficking victims in Turkey are primarily from Central and South Asia, Eastern Europe, Syria, Indonesia, and Morocco. Of the 303 victims identified in 2017, Syrians continued to make up the largest number of victims (86 in 2017 and 36 in 2016) from a single country, followed by Kyrgyz (31), Moroccans (25), Afghans (21), Moldovans (20), and Uzbeks (19). Some Georgian men and women are subjected to forced labor. Foreign victims are commonly promised jobs in entertainment, modeling, or domestic work, but upon arrival are forced by traffickers into labor or prostitution in hotels, discos, and homes. Some Turkish men are subjected to trafficking in Azerbaijan and Israel. Roma and refugee children are vulnerable to trafficking while working on the street collecting garbage, selling ftowers and other items, or begging. Reports indicate some youth in Turkey joined the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a U.S.-designated terrorist organization under circumstances that remain unclear.Turkey continues to host a large refugee population that is increasingly vulnerable to trafficking: approximately three and a half million displaced Syrians, 145,000 Afghans, and 140,000 Iraqis resided in Turkey during the reporting period. Syrian refugee and other children engaged in street begging and also reportedly worked in agriculture, restaurants, textile factories, markets, shops, and other workplaces, at times acting as the breadwinners for their families. Some are vulnerable to forced labor. Experts reported children worked long hours, with low wages, in some cases in substandard working conditions. Some reports claimed some Syrian and other girls were sold into marriages in which they were vulnerable to domestic servitude and sex trafficking.

Despite the lack of significant efforts, the government took some steps to address trafficking, including drafting standard operating procedures (SOPs) for victim identification and referral in partnership with an international organization, and implementing a legal amendment that provided free legal assistance to individuals who apply for official status as trafficking victims. However, the government continued to use the forced labor of reportedly tens of thousands of its adult citizens in the annual cotton harvest and in preparation for the Asian Indoor and Martial Arts Games (AIMAG). No officials were held accountable for their role or direct complicity in trafficking crimes, and the continued imprisonment and abuse of an independent observer of the cotton harvest dissuaded monitoring of the harvest during the reporting period. The legal provisions on victim protection were not implemented, and the government did not fund any victim assistance programs.

While the government reportedly collaborated with an international organization on the implementation of its national action plan, it did not take steps to end the use of forced labor during the cotton harvest and in preparation for the AIMAG. The 2016 anti-trafficking law called for the creation of an interagency anti-trafficking committee, comprised of several cabinet-level agencies and under the authority of the cabinet of ministers, to coordinate, plan, monitor, and report on the government's anti-trafficking efforts and analyze trends, improve victim protection measures, raise awareness, and monitor implementation of the national action plan. The interagency anti-trafficking committee was not established in 2017, but an interagency working group was established. The 2016 law also assigned responsibilities for anti-trafficking efforts among government agencies and charges the cabinet of ministers with planning, funding, and implementing anti-trafficking policy. The law required the Ministry of Internal Affairs to record data on trafficking crimes; however, the government has not reported any systematic efforts to monitor its anti-trafficking efforts, and government data on the incidence of trafficking and trafficking-related prosecutions was not publicly available. The government maintained an official website that provided information on the risks of becoming a trafficking victim and cooperated with NGOs to conduct awareness campaigns in rural areas targeting vulnerable populations. The campaigns included trainings, information sessions, workshops, round tables, movie demonstrations, and school discussions. The government did not report efforts to punish labor recruiters or brokers involved in the fraudulent recruitment of workers. The stateless population in Turkmenistan, mostly consisting 431UGANDAof former Soviet citizens, was vulnerable to trafficking; in 2017 the government granted citizenship to 1,690 stateless persons permanently living in Turkmenistan. The government made efforts to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts by routinely arresting purchasers of commercial sex, but did not make efforts to reduce the demand for forced labor.","prosecution":"The government maintained negligible anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts. Article 1291 of the criminal code prohibited all forms of trafficking in persons and prescribed penalties of four to 10 years imprisonment, which could be increased to 25 years imprisonment under aggravated circumstances; these penalties were sufficiently stringent and, with respect to sex trafficking, commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. Turkmenistan's Administrative Offense Code prescribed punitive fines and penalties for failure to prohibit forced labor, the disclosure of information that could harm a victim, or the failure to provide assistance to victims. Penalties ranged from 200 to 500 manat ($57 to $143) for private citizens, 500 to 1,000 manat ($143 to $286) for government officials, and fines from 1,000 to 2,000 manat ($286 to $573) or administrative suspension of up to three months for businesses.The government reported it initiated prosecution of three cases in 2017, the same number as in 2016 and 2015, and compared to six cases in 2014. The government reported the conviction of one trafficker in 2017, compared with three traffickers in 2016, nine in 2015, and nine in 2014. In partnership with an international organization, the government provided training for 160 officials on trafficking-related issues. Despite continued reports of widespread corruption, the government did not report any investigations, prosecutions, or convictions of government employees complicit in human trafficking offenses, nor did it report any efforts to end officials' mobilization of persons for forced labor. Corruption and official complicity in trafficking crimes remained significant concerns, inhibiting law enforcement action during the year. In October 2016, the government arrested and charged Gaspar Matalaev, a reporter who contributed to an article documenting the use of forced labor in the annual cotton harvest, with fraud. Authorities allegedly tortured Matalaev and forced him to confess to taking and distributing photographs of the cotton harvest; Matalaev was sentenced to three years in a labor camp. He remained in prison at the end of the reporting period.","protection":"The government decreased protection efforts. The government identified one victim in 2017, compared to 11 victims in 2016, 12 in 2015, and 19 in 2014. An international organization reported assisting 20 victims, but estimated the total number of victims was significantly higher, as evidenced by the 3,041 calls to the foreign-funded Ashgabat trafficking hotline. A second trafficking hotline, based in Turkmenabad, suspended operations in 2017 due to lack of funding. Despite the anti-trafficking law requiring the provision of a wide range of services from the government to trafficking victims, the government did not provide comprehensive services to all trafficking victims, nor did it fund international organizations or NGOs to provide such services. An NGO operated one shelter for female trafficking victims in Turkmenistan with foreign-donor funding. The shelter provided comprehensive services to five female victims in 2017, including local reintegration and job placement. In accordance with the national action plan, the government continued to partner with an international organization to draft SOPs for victim identification and referral, but did not finalize or adopt them. Authorities remained without formal written procedures to identify victims or refer them to care providers, but informally referred suspected trafficking victims to an international organization for services. Some law enforcement agencies only reported individuals as identified trafficking victims if their cases led to trafficking convictions. The prosecutor general's office reported victims could apply for physical protection and assistance in obtaining free medical care; however, officials did not provide details of specific cases in which such assistance was provided during the year, and NGOs indicated previously that some victims were required to pay for their own medical treatment. The anti-trafficking law provided that victims, including those who participate in criminal proceedings, were exempt from administrative or criminal liability for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being subjected to trafficking, and were guaranteed employment. It also required law enforcement agencies to respect the confidentiality of victims. An additional amendment to the legal code, effective February 2017, provided for free legal assistance to trafficking victims who apply for official status as such. Prosecutors reported they would not pressure victims into giving information in support of prosecution efforts. There were no reports of victims seeking or obtaining restitution in civil suits. The government made no attempts to identify sex trafficking victims among women arrested for engaging in prostitution. Consequently, officials may have penalized sex trafficking victims for prostitution offenses. After some Turkmen, including trafficking victims, returned home from other countries, the migration service reportedly blocked them from exiting Turkmenistan for a period of up to five years. ","recommendation":" Take action to end the use of forced adult labor, especially during the annual cotton harvest, particularly by modifying government policies that create pressure for mobilization of labor; hold complicit officials criminally accountable for their involvement in trafficking crimes; provide victim care services directly or by otherwise funding organizations to do so, as required under the 2016 anti-trafficking law; grant independent observers full access to monitor cotton cultivation and fully cease harassment, detention, and abuse of individuals for documenting labor conditions; train police to recognize and investigate sex and labor trafficking crimes; finalize and adopt formal written procedures to identify and refer victims to protection services and train police, migration officers, and other relevant officials on such procedures; while respecting due process, investigate and prosecute suspected sex and labor trafficking offenses under article 1291 of the criminal code and convict and punish traffickers; expand training for relevant government authorities on implementation of the provisions 430TURKMENISTANof the 2016 anti-trafficking law and article 129, as amended in 2016; and increase awareness of trafficking among the general public through government-run campaigns or financial support for NGO-run campaigns. ","tier":"TIER 3","traffick_profile":"As reported over the past five years, Turkmenistan is a source country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking. Forced labor constitutes Turkmenistan's largest trafficking problem; in 2016, an ILO Committee of Experts' report noted \ufb01with deep concern the widespread use of forced labor in cotton production.\ufb02 To meet government-imposed quotas for the cotton harvest, local authorities required university students, private-sector institutions, soldiers, and public sector workers (including teachers, doctors, nurses, and others) to pick cotton without payment and under the threat of penalty. In 2017, there were uncorroborated media reports that the government mobilized children for the first time in several years. Government officials threatened public sector workers with dismissal, reduced work hours, or salary deductions if they did not participate in the cotton harvest. Authorities threatened farmers with loss of land if they did not meet government-imposed quotas. In addition, the government compulsorily mobilized teachers, doctors, and other civil servants for public works projects, such as planting trees. Students and teachers and other public sector employees were forced to fill support roles, such as entertainment in the AIMAG without receiving compensation. Workers in the construction sector are vulnerable to forced labor. Turkmen men and women are subjected to forced labor after migrating abroad for employment in the textile, agricultural, construction, and domestic service sectors. Turkmen women are also subjected to sex trafficking abroad. Turkey and Russia are the most frequent destinations of Turkmen victims, followed by other countries in the Middle East, South and Central Asia, and Europe. Residents of rural areas in Turkmenistan are most at risk of becoming trafficking victims, both within the country and abroad.

The National Task Force, led by the MIA Permanent Secretary, with the Coordination Office to Combat Trafficking in Persons (COCTIP) serving as its secretariat, continued to implement the national action plan and coordinate all anti-trafficking efforts. The National Task Force remained without a strategic mandate to drive national anti-trafficking efforts or the authority to fund and propose improvements and activities for participating agencies\u0160which limited its effectiveness. While the National Task force did not receive funding, COCTIP reported receiving a small budget allocation from the government. In 2017, the government continued its national awareness campaigns\u0160composed of talks, media outreach, and distribution of written materials. The National Task Force and COCTIP, with funding from MIA, continued to coordinate with NGOs to conduct awareness campaigns through broadcast media and billboards, purposefully targeted at potential victims, including community outreach to schools and at religious centers. MIA continued to produce trafficking brochures and hung posters at locations where Ugandan job seekers frequented, and passport and immigration officers often counseled potentially at-risk Ugandans seeking passports about the dangers of trafficking. The MIA, in partnership with NGOs, also conducted awareness meetings for civil society, local leaders, police, immigration, labor inspectors, taxi, bus and \ufb01boda boda\ufb02 drivers, hotel operators, and security and probation officers on identification and referral of trafficking victims and focused on known recruitment areas along the border and at the international airport. The government did not operate an anti-trafficking hotline during the reporting period. During the reporting period, the government partially lifted the 2016 ban on Ugandans traveling abroad for domestic work, which was implemented due to reports of abuse and trafficking. With this change, workers could seek out employment in domestic work and travel to countries that had bilateral labor agreements with the government, which included only Saudi Arabia and Jordan, who had signed such agreements in 2015 and 2016, respectively. In 2018, the government launched the External Employment Management System, which functioned as a \"one stop\" internet portal where Ugandans could search and apply for all pre-vetted overseas employment opportunities through licensed recruitment companies. The government reported that the objective was to decrease illegal labor migration through unlicensed recruiters, which left migrants vulnerable to trafficking. Despite the new online employment system and bilateral labor agreements, destination country governments, like that of Jordan, issued visas to Ugandan migrant workers that used unlicensed companies in the country, making the protection of Ugandan citizens and pre-departure regulation efforts by the Ugandan government difficult. Additionally, Ugandan officials, in partnership with the Government of Saudi Arabia, recently launched an online labor monitoring system, which was developed to track migrant workers and receive reports of mistreatment or abuse. Immigration officials continued to scrutinize travel documents, passports, and reasons for travel before clearing travelers to depart Uganda for work 434UKRAINEin foreign countries. The government continued its oversight of labor recruitment agencies during the reporting period and reported that over 80 illegal recruitment individuals and companies were investigated and closed, and some of the staff were prosecuted for illegal recruitment for the purpose of trafficking, but did not report further information. This was particularly relevant as the government reported that over 90 percent of the registered victims had been subjected to trafficking as a result of recruitment by unlicensed labor recruitment companies. The 2005 Employment Regulations, required labor recruitment companies to register and undergo a thorough vetting process. Registered companies were required to maintain a minimum bank deposit and a credit line, to ensure they maintained the financial resources to repatriate workers if they became trafficking victims. The government reported vetting all labor requests received by local companies and all contracts executed between international employers and the Ugandan business. COCTIP reported conducting pre-departure briefings for migrant workers. As part of the government's public awareness campaign, it published a list of the 66 licensed labor recruitment companies on several Ministry webpages, compared to 63 registered agencies in 2016, and urged the public to only seek work through those agencies. In an effort to protect migrant workers, the government worked with labor recruitment agencies to ensure that the relevant Ugandan embassies were aware of their citizens working in those countries. However, corruption reportedly inhibited oversight of labor recruitment firms, as did insufficient staffing, and loopholes in the law. For example, the media reported that foreign, usually Middle East-based, recruitment agencies would operate in Uganda by taking advantage of loopholes in the licensing of recruitment agencies; the Middle East-based agencies would acquire an internal license, vice an external license, then recruit workers directly from Uganda and illegally send them abroad by collaborating with criminals. As mandated by the 2015 Registration of Persons Act, the government continued to register its citizens and provide them with national identification numbers. The government did not provide anti-trafficking training to Uganda's troops prior to their deployment abroad as part of international peacekeeping missions, but through a foreign donor, the troops received human rights training. The government did not make discernible efforts to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts or forced labor. Uganda is not a party to the 2000 UN TIP Protocol. ","prosecution":"The government increased anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts. The 2009 anti-trafficking act criminalized sex and labor trafficking, and prescribed punishments of up to 15 years imprisonment for offenses involving adult victims and up to life imprisonment for those involving child victims. These penalties were sufficiently stringent and, with respect to sex trafficking, commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. The law also criminalized the use of a child in any armed conftict and prescribed penalties of up to the death penalty. The Children Amendment Act of 2016 confticted with the 2009 anti-trafficking act in some respects\u0160for example, it defined child sex trafficking to require force, fraud, or coercion, which was inconsistent with the definition of trafficking under international law, and it prescribed substantially lower penalties for the crime. 432UGANDAThe government reported 145 trafficking investigations, prosecutions of 52 defendants in 50 cases, and convictions of 24 traffickers in 2017 under the 2009 anti-trafficking act, compared to 114 investigations, 32 prosecutions, and 16 convictions in 2016. However, as additional details were unavailable, the number of prosecutions and convictions may have included cases of child sacrifice and illegal adoption. The government did not report the penalties assigned to convicted traffickers. The government did not report any prosecutions, or convictions of government employees complicit in human trafficking; however, corruption and official complicity in trafficking crimes remained significant concerns, inhibiting law enforcement action during the year. Following a November 2015 request from the Department of State, the Ugandan government declined to waive immunity to allow the prosecution of a Ugandan diplomat and his spouse for labor trafficking and related offenses; the couple has since departed the United States. The government did not report taking any action during the reporting period to hold the diplomat and his spouse accountable. There were allegations that officials from the office of the prime minister were complicit in several illegal activities related to the refugee settlements, including corruption, sexual exploitation and abuse, and facilitating the movement of vulnerable populations from settlements in Uganda to South Sudan. The government suspended four high-level officials in the office of the prime minister based on allegations of their involvement in illegal activities in the refugee settlements. The government is investigating the allegations. There were also several media reports of alleged complicity of police officers in child sex trafficking of refugees and coercion of refugee women to perform sexual acts in exchange for various forms of migration documentation. The media also reported that the Police Professional Standards Unit investigated several regional and district police commanders in Busia and Tororo for alleged involvement in human trafficking. Additionally, the media continued to report that some of the labor recruitment companies suspected of involvement in trafficking were associated with, or partially owned by, high-level officials, which impeded law enforcement agencies' ability to investigate their operations. An NGO continued to report that some complicit immigration officers at border crossings facilitated passage of trafficking victims. The government did not report progress on or efforts to complete the prosecution of a case from 2014 involving the Commissioner from the Ministry of Finance, charged with child trafficking. In partnership with NGOs, the government facilitated a training for 150 participants on the anti-trafficking law and case management; judges, magistrates, prosecutors, law enforcement officials, and civil society attended the training. The Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA) conducted two training sessions for 63 police officers, three prosecutors, and four probation and social welfare officers in both the Katonga and Wamala regions on trafficking and the anti-trafficking law. The Immigration Department continued to conduct monthly sessions to train its officers on anti-trafficking issues. Despite these training efforts, some police and immigration officers continued to lack an understanding of the anti-trafficking law, and may have misclassified cases or encouraged victims to accept financial compensation from traffickers in exchange for dropping their cases. Reportedly, many police had not received adequate anti-trafficking training, yet used their discretion to only send cases they deemed to be prosecutable to the Directorate of Public Prosecutions (DPP). Even cases that the police sent to the DPP frequently had incomplete investigations and did not comply with protocols for admissible evidence. Transnational cases remained difficult for law enforcement to properly investigate, often leading to poor investigations and limiting prosecutions; the DPP reportedly relied on INTERPOL to investigate transnational trafficking cases, but due to delayed responses and competing priorities, DPP dismissed several cases. Law enforcement officials also cooperated with foreign law enforcement on the cross-border \ufb01Operation Usalama,\ufb02 during which two transnational victims were rescued; additional details were not available.","protection":"The government increased protection efforts; however, insufficient funding and training for victim assistance continued to limit effectiveness during the reporting period. The government reported identifying at least 276 victims in 2017, as compared with 270 in 2016. Of the 276 trafficking victims, 82 children and 134 adults were victims of forced labor, and two children and 38 adults were victims of sex trafficking. The government also identified four adults who were victims of both sex trafficking and forced labor and 16 children who were transnational victims of forced armed conftict. Of the identified victims, 197 were transnational, the majority of all victims were women, and all of the internal victims were children, the majority of which were Karamojong. The government reported removing nearly all internal child trafficking victims from situations of exploitation, but did not report providing the children with assistance afterward. The government reported repatriating 148 victims; while approximately 100 Ugandan victims remained in trafficking situations abroad; however, these numbers included 52 victims that may not have been trafficking victims. In comparison, in 2016, the government reported repatriating 129 trafficking victims. According to the government, authorities intercepted a total of 353 Ugandan travelers, the vast majority of them female, attempting to depart to countries which officials assessed as high risk for them to become a victim of trafficking, or being unable adequately explain the purpose for their travel; this represented a significant increase from the 250 potential victims intercepted in 2016. Oman, Kenya, or Thailand were the major destination countries for both victims and intercepted potential victims of trafficking. The government did not enact the implementing regulations for the 2009 anti-trafficking act or allocate funding for the implementation of its victim protection provisions; however, the MIA completed the first draft of the implementing regulations and submitted them to the Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs for legal review. The government continued to employ victim identification and assistance guidelines for adult and child trafficking victims, and the Immigration Department distributed these guidelines to immigration officers and provided training on their implementation. However, the government remained without a formal mechanism to systematically refer trafficking victims to appropriate care. The government did not track or report how many victims it referred to care or directly assisted. It continued to rely on NGOs and international organizations to provide the vast majority of victim services via referrals to NGO-operated shelters, which provided psychological counseling, medical treatment, family tracing, resettlement support, and vocational education without contributing in-kind or financial support. Several NGOs reported assisting 132 trafficking victims during the reporting period, 45 of those victims were children; at least 88 were victims of sex trafficking, at least three were victims of forced labor, and information was not available for 43 victims. NGOs reported that the government referred at least 13 trafficking victims to care at NGOs. Victim care remained inadequate and available services were primarily for children and women, with few NGOs offering shelter for adult 433UGANDAmales. In previous years, child victims in need of immediate shelter often stayed at police stations, sometimes sleeping in impounded vehicles, or at a juvenile detention center while awaiting placement in more formal shelters. The government did not adequately assist Ugandan citizen victims identified abroad. It generally provided replacement travel documents to facilitate the repatriation of its citizens, while NGOs provided funding for return travel. However, where embassies existed, the government did not provide shelter for Ugandan nationals abroad or upon their repatriation. In response to the continued abuse of migrant worker's rights abroad, the Uganda Association of External Recruitment Agencies, a private sector entity, established a Labor Liaison Office (LLO) in Saudi Arabia during the reporting period. The LLO reported assisting more than 200 potential trafficking victims in Saudi Arabia by working with immigration officials to obtain permission for their departure, funding return travel, and resolving disputes over unpaid wages. An NGO reported repatriating 15 Ugandan trafficking victims, the majority for sex trafficking, from Turkey, Malaysia, Thailand and Egypt, and providing them with medical assistance and referral to a local NGO upon their return. In the previous reporting period, the government reported that eight Ugandan children were separated from the Allied Democratic Front armed group in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC); six of the children were repatriated by an international organization during this reporting period and two remain with host families in DRC. While the 2009 anti-trafficking act prohibits the penalization of trafficking victims for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being subjected to human trafficking, reports indicated that the government detained and placed on bond some trafficking victims, including children, in an attempt to compel them to cooperate with and periodically report to law enforcement in support of criminal investigations. In addition, police in Kampala intermittently rounded up street children, including potential trafficking victims, and held them for a number of days at a juvenile rehabilitation center before returning them to their families. Authorities sent some of the children returned to the Karamoja region to a youth training center that provided food, counseling, and three months of vocational training, before returning them to their families. Previous reports claimed that police sometimes treated street children as criminals and arbitrarily arrested and detained them in detention facilities; however, the government reported that practice officially ended and officials now took the children to NGO-run shelters, but because these shelters were frequently full, this may still have occurred. Judicial officers often encouraged trafficking victims to participate in the investigation and prosecution of their traffickers to prevent the victimization of others, but some reports indicated that law enforcement's limited capacity and inadequate sensitivity in engaging trafficking victims discouraged many from cooperating in investigations. Ugandan law permitted foreign trafficking victims to remain in Uganda during the investigation of their cases and to apply for residence and work permits, but the government did not record any victims applying for such benefits during the reporting period. The law permitted victims to keep their identities anonymous by using voice distortion and video link facilities. The law allowed victims to file civil suits against the government or their alleged traffickers for restitution; however, there were no such cases during the reporting period. There was no formal policy to provide cooperating victims and witnesses with assistance, support, or safety; the government sometimes provided food, transportation, physical protection, or in-kind support, but it was ad hoc and inconsistent, and some reports indicated that police temporarily sheltered cooperating victims in their homes. The government reported cooperating with foreign countries from the East African Community to develop a regional anti-trafficking initiative that focused on victim identification, to ensure that trafficking victims were not arrested or prosecuted for crimes they committed as a result of being subjected to trafficking; the initiative was ongoing.","recommendation":"Develop a formal mechanism to systematically refer trafficking victims to appropriate care and expand protective services for victims through partnerships with NGOs, including by allocating resources; increase efforts to investigate allegations of official complicity in trafficking crimes and prosecute and convict complicit officials; increase training for Ugandan embassies' staff on assisting trafficking victims abroad, including victim identification, providing temporary shelter, and facilitating the repatriation of victims; fully implement the protection and prevention provisions of the 2009 anti-trafficking act; replace the partial suspension of recruitment agencies sending migrant workers abroad for domestic work with consistently enforced regulations and oversight of recruitment companies, including by adopting proposed amendments to the anti-trafficking act that would increase oversight of employment contracts and extend criminal liability for trafficking offenses to labor recruiters; increase bilateral negotiations with destination country governments on migrant worker rights, including the release and repatriation of Ugandan migrant workers exploited by employers abroad; use existing laws to proactively investigate and punish labor recruiters who fraudulently recruit Ugandans; authorize an official entity to lead and coordinate national anti-trafficking efforts between ministries and oversee services for trafficking victims to ensure appropriate services are rendered; increase resources dedicated to anti-trafficking efforts; institutionalize anti-trafficking training, including victim identification techniques, for all front-line officials, including police, immigration officers, prosecutors, and judges; establish a unified system of documenting and collecting data on human trafficking cases; and accede to the 2000 UN TIP Protocol.","tier":"TIER 2","traffick_profile":":As reported over the past five years, Uganda is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking. Ugandan children as young as seven are exploited in forced labor in agriculture, fishing, forestry, cattle herding, mining, stone quarrying, brick making, carpentry, steel manufacturing, street vending, bars, restaurants, and domestic service. Traffickers exploit girls and boys in prostitution. Recruiters target girls and women aged 13-24 years for domestic sex trafficking, especially near sports tournaments and road construction projects. An international organization estimates there are between 7,000 to 12,000 children involved in prostitution in Uganda. An international organization reported that most internal trafficking victims are Ugandans, the majority of which are exploited in forced begging. Young boys and girls were the most vulnerable to internal trafficking, mainly for labor or begging in Kampala and other urban areas. Authorities subjected some prisoners in pre-trial detention to forced labor. Traffickers subject some children from the DRC, Rwanda, Burundi, Kenya, Tanzania, and South Sudan to forced agricultural labor and exploited in prostitution in Uganda. South Sudanese children in refugee settlements in northern Uganda are vulnerable to trafficking. In 2017, individuals from Rwanda and Somalia, including a Somali refugee from Nakivale Refugee Settlement, were victims of internal trafficking. Some Ugandans abducted by the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) prior to 2006 remain unaccounted for, and may remain captive with LRA elements in the DRC, the Central African Republic, and the disputed area of Kafia Kingi, which both Sudan and South Sudan claim. Traffickers have exploited trafficking victims from the DRC and Rwanda in sex trafficking in Uganda. In 2017, there were allegations that officials from the office of the prime minister were complicit in several illegal activities related to the refugee settlements, including corruption, sexual exploitation and abuse, and facilitating the movement of vulnerable populations from settlements in Uganda to South Sudan. The government suspended four high-level officials in the office of the prime minister based on allegations of their involvement in illegal activities in the refugee settlements. The government is investigating the allegations. There were also several media reports of alleged complicity of police officers in child sex trafficking of refugees and coercion of refugee women to perform sexual acts in exchange for various forms of migration documentation. In 2016, Ugandan victims were identified in neighboring countries, including Kenya, South Sudan, and the DRC. Young women remained the most vulnerable to transnational trafficking, usually seeking employment as domestic workers in the Middle East; at times Ugandan women were fraudulently recruited for employment and then exploited in forced prostitution. Ugandan migrant workers are subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking in United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait, Iraq, Iran, Egypt, Turkey, Algeria, and China. Despite the government's partial lifting of the ban on Ugandans' travel abroad for domestic work to Saudi Arabia and Jordan, some licensed and unlicensed agencies circumvented safeguard mechanisms established by the government by sending Ugandans through Kenya and Tanzania. An international organization reported identification of 14 victims in Malaysia and Thailand and additional victims in Poland, Switzerland, and Ukraine. Official complicity may have hindered government oversight of labor recruitment agencies. COCTIP reported that traffickers appear to be increasingly organized and some may have formed regional trafficking networks. NGOs reported that traffickers are frequently relatives or friends of victims, or may pose as wealthy women or labor recruiters promising vulnerable Ugandans well-paid jobs abroad or in Uganda's metropolitan areas. Reportedly, pastors, imams, and local leaders at churches and mosques have also assisted in the recruitment of domestic workers abroad, mostly for Middle Eastern countries; these leaders encourage female domestic workers to take these jobs and in turn receive a fee per worker from recruiters. Some traffickers threatened to harm the victims' family or confiscated travel documents."},"Ukraine":{"April":9.0,"Asylum Seekers":"38","August":8.0,"December":8.0,"February":14.0,"Friday":18.0,"Global Population":44246.16,"January":8.0,"July":12.0,"June":13.0,"Life Expectancy":71.95,"March":15.0,"May":15.0,"Monday":22.0,"November":7.0,"October":5.0,"Population below $1.90 a day":"0","Saturday":12.0,"September":12.0,"Sunday":9.0,"Thursday":18.0,"Tuesday":22.0,"Violence against civilians":126,"Wednesday":25.0,"fatalities":["0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","2","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","1","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0"],"government_effort":"NA","introduction":"The Government of Ukraine does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. The government demonstrated increasing efforts compared to the previous reporting period; therefore Ukraine remained on Tier 2.

However, the government did not meet the minimum standards in several key areas. Lax sentencing, likely aggravated by corruption, meant the majority of convicted traffickers avoided imprisonment, which was inadequate to deter trafficking. The moratorium on labor inspections hampered law enforcement investigations on labor trafficking cases. International organizations continued to identify far more victims than the government, indicating inadequate identification efforts by the government and a continuing lack of trust in the government's ability to protect victims. Ongoing Russian aggression continued to drain Ukrainian government resources, displacing close to two million people, and making a large population vulnerable to exploitation.

The MSP continued to maintain a list of licensed recruitment companies. The government extended a moratorium on labor inspections through December 2018 but allowed inspections when credible information of trafficking existed. The government conducted counter-trafficking pre-deployment trainings for Ukrainian troops assigned to multinational missions and provided anti-trafficking training for its diplomatic personnel. The government did not demonstrate specific efforts to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts or forced labor.","prosecution":"The government increased law enforcement efforts. Article 149 of the criminal code criminalized sex and labor trafficking and prescribed penalties of three to eight years imprisonment, which were sufficiently stringent and, with respect to sex trafficking, commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. Law enforcement investigated 346 trafficking offenses in 2017, compared with 112 in 2016. These included 142 instances of sex trafficking, 17 for labor trafficking, 163 for forced involvement in criminal activity, and six for forced begging. Authorities initiated prosecutions of 66 cases in court in 2017, compared to 45 cases in 2016. The government convicted 23 traffickers in 2017 under article 149, a slight decrease from 28 in 2016, and the lowest in six years. Of the 23 convicted traffickers sentenced in 2017, only seven (30 percent) received prison sentences, which ranged from three to five years, and the government confiscated assets from two defendants; in 2016, only five of 28 (18 percent) convicted traffickers received prison sentences. The national police created a department to address abuses of migrant workers abroad to assist in trafficking investigations. It also established an analytics department to improve the operative analysis of available crime data, to include trafficking. The Border Guard Service reported that due to cooperation with the police, they were able to stop 20 cross-border trafficking channels. Authorities collaborated with foreign governments on transnational investigations and extraditions, including Moldova, Russia, Turkey, Poland, Netherlands, Belarus, France, Greece, and Lithuania.Official complicity and willful negligence resulted in the abuse of children in state-run institutions and orphanages, who were especially vulnerable to trafficking. Institutional reforms in Ukraine over the past three years led to widespread turnover in many government institutions, notably within the ranks of the national police and the judiciary. The recertification and restructuring of police units continued during the reporting period and included mandatory training and testing on trafficking, with assistance from an international organization, and reduced the number of officers suspected of corruption. The government, in conjunction with international funding and partners, increased training for judges, prosecutors, law enforcement, and other government officials. The government reported investigating and arresting several officials allegedly complicit in trafficking; however, there were no new prosecutions or convictions. Several high-profile cases remained pending with the court, including the former commander of the Kyiv City police counter-trafficking unit, three police officers, and a teacher at a government-run boarding school for orphans in Kharkiv who attempted to sell one of her students.","protection":"The government increased efforts in some areas of protection. The Cabinet of Ministers introduced draft legislation intended to increase the safety of persons with disabilities from exploitation, improve procedures for establishing victim status, expand the network of victim service providers, and improve protections for foreign victims and stateless persons; the legislation remained pending in Parliament at the close of the reporting period. The government significantly increased identification through the national referral mechanism. The police identified 349 victims in 2017 (103 in 2016). The government continued to rely on international organizations and NGOs, with international donor funding, to identify victims and provide the vast majority of victim protection and assistance. In 2017, an international organization in Ukraine assisted 1,256 victims, compared with 1,105 in 2016. International organizations and the government reported the majority of identified victims were subjected to labor exploitation. Authorities approved 195 of 273 applications requesting official victim status in 2017, compared to 110 of 124 in 2016 and 83 of 91 in 2015. Of the 78 cases not approved in 2017, 34 were refused and 41 applications 436UKRAINEwere incomplete\u0160the other cases remained pending. The government increased cooperation with NGOs and waived in-person interview requirements to grant official victim status to four Ukrainians incarcerated abroad for actions committed as a result of being trafficked, which resulted in their release and repatriation. Victims not requiring specialized services may have chosen to not pursue official victim status. The government increased efforts on proactive victim identification and held national workshops with stakeholders to improve cooperation on victim identification within the context of the national referral mechanism. Ongoing decentralization reforms obscured local communities' chains of responsibility for decisions regarding provision of key social services, including identifying, referring, and assisting trafficking victims. The law directed law enforcement officials to proactively identify trafficking victims; however, individuals in prostitution were not always screened for signs of trafficking. Some victims trafficked for prostitution may have been subjected to administrative charges. The government disbursed 98,800 hryvnia ($3,510) to the national budget and 219,220 hryvnia ($7,790) to local budgets for anti-trafficking measures in 2017, maintaining allocations from the previous year. State authorities allocated 1.7 million hryvna ($61,330) for the implementation of the national action plan over the next four years\u016047 percent above what is called for in the plan. The government increased the amount of financial assistance provided to each officially recognized victim, and the amounts provided were greater than the official subsistence level. Ukraine's trafficking law entitled victims to housing at a government shelter, psychological assistance, medical services, employment counseling, and vocational training, regardless of whether a criminal case proceeded or the victim cooperated with law enforcement. Authorities assigned victims with official status a case management team, which provided referrals to care facilities, NGOs, or other services according to an individualized plan. Some victims requiring shelter stayed at a rehabilitation center run by an international organization with funding from international donors, housed in a state-run hospital. Adult victims could also stay at government-run centers for socio-psychological assistance for up to 90 days and receive psychological and medical support, lodging, food, and legal assistance. The government increased the number of centers for socio-psychological assistance from 20 to 21 and maintained 692 additional social services centers. Observers reported the provision of assistance was problematic due to funding shortfalls and high turnover of trained staff. Authorities could accommodate child victims in centers for socio-psychological rehabilitation of children for up to 12 months and administer social, medical, psychological, education, legal, and other types of assistance. The government, often in cooperation with international organizations, provided significantly more training for government officials on victim identification and assistance during the reporting period than last year. The Ministry for Social Policy (MSP), in cooperation with an international organization, implemented an interactive e-learning module on the identification and referral of trafficking victims. The government reported it assisted in the repatriation of nine Ukrainian victims from Armenia, Azerbaijan, Cyprus, Georgia, and Turkey. Victims had the legal right to file civil suits for restitution, and courts ordered restitution payments for 24 trafficking victims in 2017, compared to 79 in 2016. Various protective measures were legally available inside courtrooms for victims who testified at trial, but in practice, it is not clear that authorities consistently applied these measures and treated trafficking victims in a victim-sensitive manner. The government reported changing personal data of victims for security purposes in four cases in 2017, as opposed to two in 2016. NGOs reported the government often did not provide legal assistance or other support to victims during criminal cases.Officials reported screening illegal migrants for indicators of trafficking. Authorities did not recognize any foreign victims in 2017, but international organizations reported identifying three victims from Moldova, Russia, and Uzbekistan. Foreign victims were entitled to the same benefits as Ukrainian citizens. Legislation that would allow foreign victims to remain in Ukraine for extended periods and work legally in the country remained pending with the government. There was no legal way for foreign victims to extend their stay, change legal residency, secure employment rights, or seek protection from deportation to countries where they would face hardship or retribution. There were no reports the government penalized victims for crimes committed as a direct result of being subjected to trafficking; however, due to uneven screening, it is possible that authorities may have detained, deported, or punished trafficking victims. ","recommendation":"Punish convicted traffickers with proportionate and dissuasive sentences; clearly define administrative chains of responsibility and competencies of service providers throughout the decentralization process to minimize disruption in the processes of identification, referral, and assistance to trafficking victims; vigorously investigate and prosecute trafficking offenses, including public officials complicit in trafficking crimes; certify more victims to ensure they are afforded their rights under the trafficking law and modify the procedure for granting victim status to lessen the burden on victims to self-identify and divulge sensitive information; increase law enforcement monitoring of recruitment firms engaged in fraudulent practices associated with exploitation; continue to provide adequate resources for and fully implement the 2016-2020 national action plan; increase training for law enforcement, prosecutors, and judges in the investigation and prosecution of trafficking cases, particularly on forced labor, a victim-centered approach, and how to gather evidence outside of victims' testimony; develop victim-witness protection measures and take active measures to end intimidation of victims during legal procedures; increase training for officials on victim identification, particularly in proactive screening for labor trafficking and of vulnerable populations, such as women in prostitution, children in sex trafficking, foreign migrant workers, and internally displaced persons; enact legislation to strengthen protections for foreign victims; continue to fund services to support trafficking victims, including rehabilitation centers; and increase cooperation with law enforcement officials in countries where Ukrainians are subjected to human trafficking.","tier":"TIER 2","traffick_profile":"As reported over the past five years, Ukraine is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children predominantly subjected to forced labor and, to a lesser extent, to sex trafficking. Ukrainian victims are subjected to sex trafficking and forced labor in Ukraine as well as in Russia, Poland, Moldova, and other parts of Europe, Kazakhstan, and the Middle East. Some Ukrainian children and vulnerable adults are subjected to forced begging. A small number of 437UNITED ARAB EMIRATESforeign nationals, including those from Moldova, Russia, and Uzbekistan are subjected to forced labor in Ukraine. Victims trafficked in Ukraine have been exploited in a variety of sectors including construction, agriculture, manufacturing, domestic work, the lumber industry, nursing, and street begging; experts report the number of foreign victims in Ukraine has fallen dramatically since the beginning of hostilities in eastern Ukraine. Smuggled migrants transiting Ukraine are vulnerable to human trafficking. The approximately 82,000-200,000 children institutionalized in state-run orphanages were especially vulnerable to trafficking. Officials of several state-run institutions and orphanages were allegedly complicit or willfully negligent in the sex and labor trafficking of girls and boys under their care.Fueled by Russian aggression, the conftict in eastern Ukraine has displaced nearly two million people, and this population is especially vulnerable to exploitation. In areas controlled by the Russia-led forces, the situation has become particularly challenging. Employment options are limited and Russia's proxy \ufb01authorities\ufb02 have restricted international humanitarian aid that would help meet civilian needs. Women and girls from conftict-affected areas have reportedly been kidnapped for the purposes of sex and labor trafficking in Ukraine and Russia. Internally displaced persons were subjected to trafficking, and some Ukrainians were subjected to forced labor on territory not under government control, often via kidnapping, torture, and extortion. The large, displaced population and economic crisis has increased vulnerability of Ukrainians to trafficking throughout the country. International experts reported the demographics of Ukrainian trafficking victims has shifted since the beginning of the conftict to include more urban, younger, and male victims subjected increasingly to forced labor and criminality, such as drug trafficking and couriers. Russia's proxies in eastern Ukraine issued decrees calling for the conscription of minors and Russia-led forces used children as soldiers, informants, and human shields. A civil society organization stated that it recorded 85 cases of involvement of children in illegal armed groups in areas outside of Ukraine's control; it reported it was able to identify names, ages, forms of recruitment, children's duties, and the identities of recruiters. According to the organization, children took direct and indirect part in the armed conftict; they performed armed duty at checkpoints as fighters and served as guards, mailpersons, and secretaries. The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine reported children as young as 15 took part in active combat as part of Russia-led forces. Children ages 15 to 17 were actively recruited to participate in militarized youth groups that taught children to carry and use weapons. A Ukrainian government official reported that one children's battalion associated with this training program, the St. George the Victor Battalion, may have included children as young as 12 years. The recruitment of children by militant groups took place on territory not under the control of the government and in areas where the government was unable to enforce national prohibitions against the use of children in armed conftict.

The government made key achievements during the reporting period; therefore Uzbekistan was upgraded to Tier 2 Watch List. These achievements included taking substantive actions towards ending the use of forced adult labor during the annual cotton harvest by increasing remuneration to pickers and cotton procurement prices; demobilizing students and, to a lesser extent, partially demobilizing some in other government-directed labor sectors; allowing full unimpeded access to international third-party monitors; and engaging in dialogue with activists and treating them in a more humane manner. At the highest levels, the government publically acknowledged as a problem forced labor in the cotton harvest. The government conducted a substantial campaign to raise awareness of the prohibition against child labor in the harvest for a fourth year, and reports of children being mobilized were extremely limited. Despite these achievements, government-compelled forced labor remained during the 2017 cotton harvest; approximately 336,000 pickers of an estimated 2.6 million workforce were forced laborers. The government did not consistently implement its ban on the mobilization of public sector employees. It demonstrated decreased efforts in victim identification, as well as the investigation and prosecution of suspected traffickers. 451UZBEKISTAN","iso3":"UZB","latitude":["41.3167","41.3167","40.7983","41.6172","39.9095","40.1158","40.1041","41.4409","41.3167","41.3167","41.2507","39.0397"],"location":["Tashkent","Tashkent","Gurumsaray","Kyzylsu","Kattakurgan","Jizzakh","Navoi","Mamay","Tashkent","Tashkent","Kasansay","Kasan"],"longitude":["69.25","69.25","70.9374","69.8836","66.2651","67.8422","65.3747","71.6906","69.25","69.25","71.5438","65.5774"],"notes":"On 10 December, the former representative of Uzbekistan to the OSCE was arrested in Tashkent and charged with high treason. According to HRW and local activists, he was under pressure and tortured in detention, in order to obtain his confession. On 7 December, a resident of Tashkent was reportedly beaten by law enforcers in order to provide his confession of a robbery in the house of a local official. Later he was transferred to a hospital for treatment. On 27 November, law enforcers of the traffic police reportedly attacked a driver, resident of the village of Gurumsaray, Popsky district of Namangan region, and beat him to death. Reportedly he did not follow their order to stop his vehicle. He was transferred to the hospital but died. On 30 September, police detained and questioned around 40 ethnic Korean protestant Christians for 12 hours for attending a Sunday service in Kyzl-Su, Tashkent region, resulting in the hospitalization of two of them as a result of 'psychological pressure'. Equipment, religious literature and other items were confiscated and they later received large fines. On 3 July, law enforcement officers detained two women, suspecting them of theft in Kattarkurgan. They forced the detained women to strip and captured the scene on video. On 26 May, \"anti-terror\" police officers 'harshly' interrogated and prosecuted a female Jehovah's Witness in Jizzakh after confiscating a phone with religious materials on it. On 10 May, an inmate of a penal colony in Navoi was subjected to a systematic torture for religious reasons. Officers allegedly attacked him, broke his teeth and jaw. It was reported by his wife on May 23 and later confirmed by another source. On 7 April, the border guards of Uzbekistan shot a citizen of Kyrgyzstan - a resident of the Kurulush village, Jalal-Abad region. Allegedly he was on the territory of Kyrgyzstan at the moment of incident (near the village of Mamay). Later he died in a hospital. The incident raised tensions and resulted in mutual agreement of both governments to avoid violence against civilians in such cases in the future. On 8 March, residents of Ukchi-Almazar district of Tashkent were forcibly evicted to leave their homes and later charged with administrative offences. The city administration ordered to demolish the buildings because of a planned construction of a new business center. Direct violence by law-enforcers against the residents was reported. On 3 February, relatives of a jailed journalist declared that he had been victim of a torture and ill-treatment in Tashkent since his detention on 27 September 2017. On 27 January, a Kyrgyz citizen was injured on the border between Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan. He had crossed the border very close to the Azhek settlement, Ala-Buka district in Kyrgyzstan\/Kasansay Uzbekistan [coded to Kasansay], while looking after his sheep; after being spotted by the Uzbek border guard, he tried to escape to Kyrgyzstan, but the Uzbek forces opened fire and injured him. The shepherd was transported to an Uzbek hospital. On 4 January, prisoners in a facility in the Kasan district of the Kashkadarya region were reportedly beaten and tortured. According to their relatives, the guards were torturing a huge group of them - beating and humiliating without any reason.","prevention":"The government increased prevention efforts. The government took steps to modify agricultural policies that created pressure for the use of forced labor, including by increasing wages to pickers, increasing cotton purchasing prices to farmers, and beginning implementation of its commitment not to mobilize teachers, medical workers, and college and lyceum students. The 2017 harvest marked the fourth consecutive year the government conducted a nationwide campaign to raise public awareness of its prohibition of child labor in the cotton harvest. International observers and Uzbek activists acknowledged the government's eradication of systemic child labor, including systemic compelled child labor, although anecdotal reports of forced child labor continued in a limited number of instances. The government, in coordination with the ILO, conducted an awareness raising campaign to ensure all citizens were aware of their labor rights. The campaign featured over 400 roadside banners along major highways, and the distribution of brochures and posters to educational and health care facilities, as well as informative commercials on major television and radio networks. However, the central government continued to demand farmers and local officials fulfill state-assigned cotton production quotas, leading to the mobilization of adult forced labor; the ILO estimated that of the workforce of approximately 2.6 million, at least 336,000 were forced or coerced to work. Farmers who were unable to fulfill their quotas risked losing the rights to farm their government leased land; there was at least one report of this occurring during the reporting period. Although teachers, students, and medical workers were initially mobilized, the government did implement a recall of these groups from the cotton fields in the early stages of the harvest in September 2017. The ban on these pickers was unevenly implemented, with reports that some public sector employees returned to the fields within weeks of the demobilization. According to observers, the 2017 harvest saw an unprecedented increase in the coercion of public sector employees to pick cotton, or pay for a replacement worker, creating a penalty for not participating in the forced labor system. Officials required, and in some cases compelled, state employees and adult students to sign labor agreements or statements that they would pick cotton voluntarily. Independent observers asserted that public employees were instructed to tell monitors that they were unemployed. \ufb01Cotton command units,\ufb02 led by local government officials, personally visited households of unemployed people or the homes of individuals who did not show up in the fields in order to ensure their mobilization. For a third consecutive year, the government agreed to allow the ILO to monitor the cotton harvest for child and forced labor, allowed ILO monitors access to the cotton fields accompanied by government monitors, and allowed the ILO to publish the results of a survey of the prevalence of child and forced labor during the 2017 harvest. ILO monitors were granted unimpeded access to interview laborers, unlike in previous years. Although, as in previous years, a government official accompanied ILO monitors to field observations, the official was not privy to the observation location before the monitoring team arrived at the destination, and did not observe or participate in the interviews. The official's participation served largely to ensure access to the fields if local officials questioned the ILO's presence. The government continued to publicize its Cotton Harvest Feedback Mechanism, which included telephone hotlines and messaging apps dedicated to receiving reports of labor violations, receiving over 7,300 inquiries and complaints, 121 of which were related to labor rights during the cotton harvest. Of the complaints received, 36 were related to forced labor and eight resulted in the discovery of confirmed child labor cases. Government officials identified 641 persons forced into the fields, opened 42 lawsuits, issued 116 administrative citations, and issued fines totaling 220.5 million soum ($27,460) as a result of information received through the feedback mechanism. Observers reported concerns about the effectiveness of the feedback mechanism, stating that some pickers had concerns about reprisals or the effectiveness of investigations. Although activists reported less physical abuse and decreased harassment as compared to previous years, temporary detentions, surveillance, and some harassment continued. For the first time, in 2017 the government investigated forced labor cases identified by activists, resulting in administrative penalties for local officials. Media reported on forced labor practices for the first time; bloggers who highlighted forced labor problems were not penalized or censored. Some state media outlets featured audio or video recordings of public officials encouraging civil servants to participate in the cotton harvest, which publicly shamed the officials and increased labor rights awareness. The government slightly reduced the area of land available for the cultivation of cotton and increased its capacity for mechanization by continuing to develop appropriate cotton cultivars and by training farmers on mechanization. The government continued several projects aimed at modernization of the cotton industry, including a five-year partnership on agricultural reform with the World Bank, which included measures to prevent forced labor; a four year Decent Work Country Program extension to improve employment opportunities, working conditions and social protections; and began implementation of pilot projects with the International Finance Corporation and private companies to work on mechanization and responsibly cultivated cotton. Additionally, the government implemented ILO recommendations, such as increasing both remuneration to pickers and purchasing prices available to farmers. The Uzbek Agency for Foreign Labor Migration increased outreach to prospective labor migrants, serving to reduce potential risks of trafficking among this population. The Agency conducted pre-departure consultations on labor and migration laws in the country of destination. The government reported 34 migrants used these centers before departures for work in 453VENEZUELARussia. The government also signed agreements with Russia, Japan, and Poland in 2017 to establish centers for training workers for jobs in these countries. A representative Russian Ministry of Interior office opened in Samarkand in November 2017. Media reports indicate that 12 Uzbek citizens found employment in Poland through the agreement. The national government conducted monitoring visits and provided training to a national network of local-level commissions. Authorities promoted wide-scale public awareness efforts on transnational sex and labor trafficking, including through events, print media, television, and radio, often through partnering with and providing in-kind support to NGOs. The government maintained several hotlines in addition to the cotton harvest feedback mechanism\u0160one of which provided free legal advice; in 2017 the lines received 125 requests related to migration and human trafficking. An NGO maintained a foreign donor-funded hotline. The NGO received 2,879 phone calls; among these calls were 224 allegations of human trafficking and 712 requests for repatriation. The organization accepted 70 repatriation requests by trafficking victims and assisted a total of 205 people. The government prohibited the participation of educational institutions in scrap metal collection. The government did not conduct efforts to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts. ","prosecution":"The government decreased law enforcement efforts. Article 135 of the criminal code criminalized labor and sex trafficking and prescribed penalties of three to five years imprisonment, which were sufficiently stringent and, with respect to sex trafficking, commensurate with punishments prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. For the fourth year in a row, investigations, prosecutions, and convictions declined. The government conducted 609 investigations, including 204 cases of sexual exploitation and 32 cases of labor exploitation, and prosecuted 314 cases for crimes related to trafficking in 2017, compared to 651 investigations and 361 prosecutions in 2016 and 696 investigations and 372 prosecutions in 2015. Authorities reported convicting 405 people for crimes related to trafficking in 2017, compared to 451 in 2016. The government reported that 204 of the crimes investigated in 2017 were related to sexual exploitation. The government did not provide sufficient detail to determine if the reported statistics related to trafficking or sexual exploitation met the definition of trafficking under the TVPA. The government reported convicting 391 perpetrators under article 135, including 33 recruiters; 233 convictions carried a prison sentence, 81 carried conditional sentences, 57 carried limitation of freedom, three carried a sentence of correctional labor, two were required to pay fines, and 15 individuals were granted amnesty.The Ministry of Interior (MOI) maintained an investigatory unit dedicated to trafficking crimes. The government provided trafficking-specific training to police, judges, and other authorities. In addition to attending state-funded training, government officials participated in seminars and conferences sponsored by the government and taught by NGOs, international organizations, and foreign governments. Despite official complicity in the cotton harvest and other sectors with forced labor, the government did not report any criminal investigations, prosecutions, or convictions of government officials complicit in human trafficking offenses during the reporting period. It reported issuing administrative fines to 14 officials in 2017, compared to nine in 2016, for forced labor violations; the government levied administrative penalties also in Andijon region, in spite of the public promise made by the regional Hokim to criminally prosecute senior officials complicit in the recruitment of teachers, school and college students, as well as workers of medical institutions. For the first time, the government initiated investigations into allegations of forced labor when reported by activists.","protection":"The government decreased efforts to identify, assist, and protect victims of sex and transnational labor trafficking, and it made limited efforts to assist victims of forced labor in the cotton harvest or other internal sectors. The government identified 440 victims of trafficking-related crimes in 2017, a decrease from 714 in 2016 and 924 in 2015. Media reported that 47 percent of the government-assisted victims were women and 53 percent were men. The government did not provide details on how many of these victims endured exploitation in Uzbekistan. The government did not identify any victims of foreign origin and reported that the majority of identified victims were subjected to sex trafficking abroad. NGOs and an international organization identified and assisted 676 trafficking victims in 2017 (327 in 2016 and 774 in 2015), the vast majority of which were subjected to labor exploitation abroad. Uzbekistan's diplomatic missions abroad helped repatriate 40 victims, a decrease from 109 victims in 2016, by issuing travel documents, and worked with IOM to provide food, clothing, and transportation to victims to facilitate their repatriation to Uzbekistan. The government lacked a standardized process to proactively identify victims from vulnerable populations and refer those victims to protective services, especially those subjected to internal trafficking, which led to the penalization of potential victims, particularly those in prostitution. Police, consular officials, and border guards who were able to identify potential trafficking victims could refer them to either a state-run shelter or NGOs for services. To be eligible to receive government-provided rehabilitation and protection services, the government required victims to file a criminal complaint with the authorities in their community of origin, after which the MOI had to decide whether or not to initiate an investigation and grant official victim status to the individual. As a result, NGOs reported local officials regularly referred victims who did not wish to pursue a criminal case to NGO offices for assistance.The government allocated approximately 540 million soum ($67,250), an increase from 496 million soum (approximately $61,770) in 2016, to operate its Tashkent-based trafficking rehabilitation center for men, women, and children with official victim status. The government did not provide definitive data on the number of victims assisted at this facility in 2017, compared to 460 victims in 2016. This center provided shelter, medical, psychological, legal, and job placement assistance. Victims could discharge themselves from the shelter, although in previous 452UZBEKISTANyears, authorities at times required victims to stay to assist a criminal case. The center had the capacity to accommodate foreign victims, but there have been no foreign victims in the shelter since its opening. The government provided funding to local NGOs to conduct vocational trainings and provide health services for victims, in addition to according them tax benefits and the use of government-owned land. These NGOs provided critical services because officials referred victims of sex trafficking to them, and those who did not wish to pursue a criminal case and were therefore ineligible to access the state-run shelter. The law does not exempt transnational sex and labor trafficking victims from facing a criminal penalty for illegally crossing the border. NGOs reported authorities dropped these charges when NGOs proved to authorities the victims were subjected to human trafficking. NGOs also noted that MOI officials increasingly complied with legal requirements to maintain victim confidentiality; however, victims' identities were not kept confidential during court proceedings. Victims could bring civil suits against traffickers, but the government did not provide legal representation for victims, and most victims could not afford legal representation on their own; despite the absence of an effective mechanism to seek restitution from their traffickers, one trafficking victim received court ordered restitution in 2017.","recommendation":"Continue substantive actions to end the use of forced adult labor, including during the annual cotton harvest, through such measures as eliminating cotton production quotas and increasing remuneration and improving working conditions for workers in the cotton harvest; fully implement commitments to neither mobilize teachers, medical workers, and college and lyceum students in forced labor, nor require them to pay for replacement pickers; provide adequate mechanisms to enable all citizens to refuse to participate in the cotton harvest or other work outside their professional duties without suffering consequences; respecting due process, increase investigations and, when sufficient evidence exists, criminally prosecute officials complicit in human trafficking, including officials involved in mobilizing forced labor; improve procedures for identifying trafficking victims to ensure they are systematic and proactive; continue efforts to investigate and prosecute suspected traffickers, respecting due process; continue granting independent observers full access to monitor cotton cultivation and fully cease harassment, detention, and abuse of activists for documenting labor conditions, and investigate, and, when sufficient evidence exists, criminally prosecute persons complicit in human trafficking identified by observers; continue implementing the national action plan for improving labor conditions in the agricultural sector; continue to modify agricultural policies to reduce pressure for farmers and officials to compulsorily mobilize labor for the cotton harvest; continue promoting awareness of labor rights, including in regard to the cotton harvest; continue improving processes for registering and investigating violations of labor rights; fund anti-trafficking NGOs assisting and sheltering victims who were not admitted to the state-run shelter; develop formal mechanisms to ensure victims are not penalized for acts committed as a result of being subjected to trafficking, including for illegal border crossing and losing personal identification documents; and amend the criminal code to protect the identities of trafficking victims and encourage prosecutors to proactively seek victim restitution in criminal cases.","tier":"TIER 2 WATCH LIST","traffick_profile":"As reported over the past five years, Uzbekistan is a source and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and women and children subjected to sex trafficking. The ILO and observers noted that the systemic mobilization of child labor was eliminated, although there were anecdotal reports of the use of child labor in some areas. Government-compelled forced labor of adults, including employees of schools and medical facilities, remained during the fall cotton harvest, and spring planting and weeding. During the 2017 cotton harvest, approximately 336,000 pickers of an estimated 2.6 million workforce were forced laborers. Despite its August decree banning mobilization of certain sectors, the government initially mobilized those under the age of 18, as well as employees in educational and medical sectors, university students, teachers, and medical workers for the 2017 cotton harvest. It unevenly implemented its September 2017 directive recalling employees of schools and medical facilities, as well as university students, from the cotton fields. International reports indicate some adults who refuse to pick cotton, do not pay for a replacement worker, or do not fulfill their daily quota can face the loss of social benefits, termination of employment, or other forms of harassment. According to some observers, the 2017 harvest saw an increase in the coercion of public sector employees, creating a penalty for not participating in the forced labor system. Private companies in some regions mobilized employees for the harvest under threat of increased government inspections of and taxes on their operations. There were reports of employees of such companies being fired for not participating in the 2017 harvest. Independent harvest monitors noted that the government's demobilization of lyceum and university students was largely successful. Government-compelled forced labor of adults remained in other sectors as well. There were isolated reports stating that local officials forced farmers to cultivate silk cocoons and, separately, that local officials forced teachers, students (including children), private businesses employees, and others to work in construction and other forms of non-cotton agriculture and to clean parks, streets, and buildings. During the 2017 harvest, the government continued to arrest independent activists attempting to observe the spring weeding and the fall harvest, though at decreased intervals and without reports of extreme abuses, as compared to previous years.Uzbek women and children were subjected to sex trafficking in the Middle East, Eurasia, and Asia, and also internally in brothels, clubs, and private residences. Uzbek men, and to a lesser extent women, were subjected to forced labor in Kazakhstan, Russia, Moldova, Turkey, and in other Asian, Middle Eastern, and European countries in the construction, oil and gas, agricultural, retail, and food sectors."},"Zambia":{"April":2.0,"Asylum Seekers":0.61,"August":1.0,"December":0.0,"February":1.0,"Friday":2.0,"Global Population":17351.71,"January":2.0,"July":1.0,"June":0.0,"Life Expectancy":63.51,"March":1.0,"May":4.0,"Monday":1.0,"November":1.0,"October":1.0,"Population below $1.90 a day":"57.5","Saturday":4.0,"September":1.0,"Sunday":1.0,"Thursday":1.0,"Tuesday":2.0,"Violence against civilians":15,"Wednesday":4.0,"fatalities":["1","1","0","2","1","1","0","1","1","0","0","0","0","0","1"],"government_effort":"NA","introduction":"The Government of Zambia does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so.

Zambian police officers who were arresting a suspect in Ndeke village beat the suspect to death.","prevention":"The government increased efforts to prevent trafficking. The government revived the national secretariat and its inter-ministerial committee, which resumed their duties in the oversight of national anti-trafficking efforts. The anti-trafficking inter-ministerial committee held its inaugural meeting on December 1, 2017. The government reviewed and updated the 2012-2015 national action plan to combat trafficking, although its finalization remained pending at the close of the reporting period. The government launched its seventh national development plan, which included guidelines on the prosecution, protection, and prevention of trafficking\u0160the first time it has specifically included goals to combat trafficking. The government conducted a baseline survey in Nakonde and Sesheke, two border areas known to have a high prevalence of trafficking, to assess gaps in understanding of the crime. In coordination with an international organization, the Ministry of Community Development and Social Welfare updated and began implementation of the Communication Strategy on Mixed Migration and Human Trafficking, which aimed to educate the public on trafficking through community outreach and interviews on local radio stations. The government continued its partnerships in the region through routine coordination of anti-trafficking efforts with Zimbabwe and South Africa. The government held three bilateral relationship cooperating meetings at border posts in Chirundu, Chanida, and Nakonde with Zimbabwean, Mozambican, and Tanzanian counterparts, respectively, to discuss cross-border initiatives and efforts to combat trafficking. The government hosted Malawi's anti-trafficking inter ministerial committee to facilitate a knowledge-sharing discussion as part of a SADC regional cooperation initiative. During 2016, MLSS employed 134 labor inspectors, compared to 110 labor officers employed the previous year. The government did not make efforts to reduce the demand for commercial sex or forced labor. An estimated 225 Zambian peacekeepers received anti-trafficking training on how to identify and protect potential trafficking victims. 459ZIMBABWE","prosecution":"The government increased anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts. The Anti Trafficking Act of 2008 criminalized some forms of labor and sex trafficking. Inconsistent with the definition 458ZAMBIAof trafficking under international law, the law only defined an offense as trafficking if it involved transnationality. Additionally, the law required a demonstration of threats, force, intimidation, or other forms of coercion to constitute a child sex trafficking offense, and therefore did not criminalize all forms of child sex trafficking. The act prescribed penalties ranging from 20 years to life imprisonment, which were sufficiently stringent and, with respect to sex trafficking, commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape.The government investigated 22 potential trafficking cases involving Ethiopian, Congolese, Rwandan, Zambian, and Somali perpetrators or victims, both adults and children, compared to 23 in 2016. The government prosecuted four traffickers, convicted all four traffickers, and sentenced them to 25 years imprisonment, compared with zero prosecutions and zero convictions during the previous reporting period. All four prosecutions and convictions were the result of a single case involving three Congolese and one Zambian trafficker who exploited 14 Congolese victims in Zambia. The Ministry of Labor and Social Security (MLSS) Child Labor Unit used mediation with parents as the usual process for handling child labor cases and did not criminally investigate such cases for potential trafficking violations. The government did not investigate or prosecute companies for labor trafficking in the mining and agricultural sectors and had limited capacity to monitor these sectors; during the previous reporting period there were allegations that large or foreign companies and foreign governments exerted inftuence over officials, preventing investigations. The government did not report any investigations, prosecutions, or convictions of government officials complicit in human trafficking offenses. The government integrated modules on human trafficking into the training curricula for Zambia Correctional Service, the Zambian Police Service, and the Department of Immigration and during the year trained such officials using these modules. The national police academy trained an unknown number of new recruits on trafficking. The paramilitary police training school trained over 1,000 recruits on trafficking. The government maintained a database to track trafficking case data with other countries in the region. ","protection":"The government increased efforts to assist victims. The government identified 41 victims during the reporting period, compared to one potential victim identified during the previous reporting period. Of the victims identified, 33 were children and eight were adults; 18 were female and 23 were male. The government referred all victims it identified to protective services. Of the victims identified, one was a sex trafficking victim and the government did not report the type of exploitation for the other 40 victims. Officials continued to conftate cases of migrant smuggling and trafficking, particularly with an inftux of refugees fteeing conftict in the DRC during the reporting period. The government partnered with international organizations to offer routine assistance to victims, including medical care and counseling, but it continued to rely on international organizations and local NGOs to provide the majority of care. Shelters across the country, especially outside Lusaka and Copperbelt Provinces, were heavily constrained by a lack of funding. The Ministry of Community Development, Mother and Child Health operated a 40 person shelter for victims of trafficking and victims of sexual abuse in Luapula province, and another in Central Province, both eligible to receive male victims of trafficking. In addition, it refurbished a shelter for vulnerable migrants and victims of trafficking in an area known to have a high prevalence of trafficking and opened a gender-based violence shelter in Chongwe for women and girls; the government did not report if any trafficking victims received care through these facilities during the year. The government increased its anti-trafficking budget for the second consecutive year to 143,000 new kwacha ($14,340), an increase of $4,000 over last reporting period. Officials and service providers used standard procedures to screen and identify trafficking victims among vulnerable populations, such as migrants and unaccompanied minors. However, the government did not adequately screen a significant number of potential Zambian victims of forced labor who returned from Namibia. Government officials, in partnership with international organizations, offered court preparation, and repatriation or regularization of immigration status. The government offered legal alternatives to the removal of victims to countries where they may face hardship or retribution; however, the government did not report granting such assistance in 2017. Foreign victims of trafficking were provided with the same protective services as Zambian nationals; however, availability of translators remained a barrier to providing timely, comprehensive care. As a result of the lack of shelter availability and resources, it was not uncommon for the government to house victims, including children, in jail for short periods.","recommendation":"Proactively identify trafficking victims by accurately distinguishing between migrant smuggling and trafficking victims and refer them to protective services; amend the trafficking law to define child sex trafficking as not requiring that force, fraud, or coercion be used and to define trafficking as a crime that does not require movement of the victim; vigorously investigate and prosecute sex and labor trafficking cases within Zambia involving both children and adults; formalize and implement victim identification and referral procedures, and train law enforcement and social welfare officials on their use, including among vulnerable populations; expand the availability of shelters; train police, immigration officials, prosecutors, and judges on investigating and prosecuting trafficking crimes; increase the number of labor inspectors and ensure they are trained on trafficking indicators; strengthen coordination and collaboration efforts between relevant ministries; finalize an updated multi-year national anti trafficking strategy and action plan and continue to conduct public awareness campaigns; and compile and make public information on trafficking cases and trends.","tier":"TIER 2","traffick_profile":"As reported over the past five years, Zambia is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking. Most trafficking occurs within the country's borders and involves women and children from rural areas exploited in cities in domestic servitude or forced labor in agriculture, textile production, mining, construction, small businesses such as bakeries, and forced begging. Zambian children may be forced by jerabo gangs engaged in illegal mining to load stolen copper ore onto trucks in Copperbelt Province. While orphans and street children are most vulnerable, children of afftuent village families are also at risk of trafficking because sending children to the city for work is perceived to confer status. Zambian boys and girls are exploited in sex trafficking by truck drivers in towns along the Zimbabwean and Tanzanian borders and by miners in Solwezi. Zambian boys are subjected to sex trafficking in Zimbabwe and women and girls are subjected to sex trafficking in South Africa. Domestically, extended families and trusted family acquaintances facilitate trafficking. Zambians from the depressed rural areas in the Western Province are coerced into forced labor in Namibia. Women and children from neighboring countries are exploited in forced labor and sex trafficking in Zambia. Nationals from South and East Asia are exploited in forced labor in domestic servitude, textile factories, bakeries, and Chinese-owned mines. Chinese traffickers bring in Chinese women and girls for sexual exploitation in brothels and massage parlors in Lusaka; traffickers use front companies posing as travel agencies to lure Chinese victims and coordinate with Zambian facilitators and middlemen. Chinese nationals are increasingly exploited in forced labor in Chinese-owned companies in the construction and mining sectors. South African criminal groups subjected Southeast Asians transiting Zambia to forced labor in construction in South Africa. Potential trafficking victims from Ethiopia, DRC, and Syria were identified in Zambia."},"Zimbabwe":{"April":19.0,"Asylum Seekers":"22","August":26.0,"December":3.0,"February":14.0,"Friday":19.0,"Global Population":14438.8,"January":14.0,"July":31.0,"June":17.0,"Life Expectancy":61.2,"March":13.0,"May":7.0,"Monday":19.0,"November":3.0,"October":3.0,"Population below $1.90 a day":"33.9","Saturday":28.0,"September":3.0,"Sunday":28.0,"Thursday":22.0,"Tuesday":10.0,"Violence against civilians":153,"Wednesday":27.0,"fatalities":["1","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","1","2","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0"],"government_effort":"NA","introduction":"The government of Zimbabwe does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so.

The government trained border and law enforcement officials, labor inspectors, social workers, and civil society organizations on victim identification and interview techniques. The anti-trafficking inter-ministerial committee (ATIMC) met quarterly and led the implementation of the national action plan, and the government launched provincial task teams in five provinces, and conducted awareness raising activities. However, the government did not demonstrate increasing efforts compared to the previous reporting period. It did not amend the 2014 Trafficking in Persons Act, which was inconsistent with international law. The government investigated and prosecuted fewer trafficking cases compared to the previous year. The government did not provide funding to its NGO partners on which it relied to provide protective services to victims and that struggled to operate without such support, and remained without formal identification and referral procedures.

The ATIMC met quarterly and led the implementation of the national action plan. The ATIMC developed guidelines for engagement between the government and civil society actors; and reviewed various national, regional, and international instruments governing the fight against trafficking. In coordination with two international organizations, the government held a three-day capacity-building workshop for members of the ATIMC, which was opened and led by the Minister for Home Affairs. During the previous year, the ATIMC launched provincial task teams in Harare and Matabeleland South and during the reporting period it continued to implement plans to create provincial anti-trafficking task teams in all 10 provinces by launching task teams in five additional provinces, including Bulawayo, Mashonaland East, Mashonaland Central, Manicaland, and Masyingo. In coordination with an international organization, the government trained the members of the task teams to equip them in their mandate and each task team drafted a work plan in line with the National Plan of Action (NAPLAC). The government continued to participate in the SADC regional data collection tool by uploading trafficking cases, victim and trafficker profiles, and sharing information with countries in the region. Through its participation in the data tool, an international organization and SADC launched the first annual draft analysis report for the region. In September 2017, the government organized and funded a commemoration of the World Day Against Trafficking in Persons in Bulawayo following the launch of its anti-trafficking task force. The Minister of Home Affairs' permanent secretary held a live television interview discussing the government's anti-trafficking efforts, the Zimbabwean Police drama group performed for the public, using drama to explain the various types of trafficking and the government distributed pamphlets, brochures, t-shirts, and wrist bands. The government set up anti-trafficking booths at the annual Zimbabwe International Trade Fair and the Harare Agricultural Show, which drew thousands of participants, handing out educational materials and hosted focus group discussions. The government developed a national action plan on migration, which prioritized the protection of unaccompanied migrant children who were vulnerable to trafficking. In September 2017, the government rolled out a mobile registration system for national identity, birth and death certificates and separately put in place measures that ensured visa applications by local Zimbabweans to known destination countries were tightened, but it did not provide details on how this was accomplished. The government provided assistance  acquiring lost or stolen identity documents for trafficking victims that were repatriated. The government did not make efforts to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts or forced labor.","prosecution":"The government had mixed anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts. Inconsistent with international law, the 2014 Trafficking in Persons Act defined trafficking in persons as a movement-based crime and did not adequately define \ufb01exploitation.\ufb02 The 2014 act criminalized the involuntary transport of a person, and the voluntary transport for an unlawful purpose, into, outside, or within Zimbabwe. The focus on transport and the inadequate definition of \ufb01exploitation\ufb02 left Zimbabwe without comprehensive prohibitions of trafficking crimes. The law prescribed penalties of 10 years to life imprisonment, which was sufficiently stringent and, with respect to sex trafficking crimes, was commensurate with penalties for other serious crimes, such as rape. Zimbabwe's Labor Relations Amendment Act criminalized forced labor and prescribed penalties of up to two years imprisonment, which were not sufficiently stringent. The Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act criminalized procuring a person for unlawful sexual conduct, inside or outside of Zimbabwe and prescribed penalties of up to two years imprisonment; these penalties were not sufficiently stringent when applied to cases of sex trafficking. The act also criminalized coercing or inducing anyone to engage in unlawful sexual conduct with another person by threat or intimidation, prescribing sufficiently stringent penalties of one to five years imprisonment. Pledging a female for forced marriage to compensate for the death of a relative or to settle any debt or obligation was punishable under the act, with penalties of up to two years imprisonment. These penalties, as applied to sex trafficking crimes, were not commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape.The government investigated two potential cases of forced labor, a decrease from 72 investigations in the previous reporting period. The government reported prosecuting 14 trafficking cases in 2017, compared with 42 prosecutions in 2016; it prosecuted five new defendants for alleged trafficking crimes, while an unknown number of defendants were involved in ongoing prosecutions. The government reported convicting three traffickers in one case, the first conviction since 2007. The case involved three Zimbabwean men who exploited four male Mozambicans in forced labor on farms in Chipinge; 460ZIMBABWEthe government sentenced all three traffickers to five years imprisonment. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs continued the ongoing investigation of trafficking cases involving Zimbabweans exploited in Kuwait. The Zimbabwe Republic Police's Victim Friendly Unit (VFU) had responsibility for investigating cases involving women and children and referring victims to support services; however, the VFU was largely inactive and did not report investigating trafficking cases during the year. In coordination with two international organizations, the government supported the training of 10 magistrates and 19 prosecutors from all 10 provinces throughout the country by peer prosecutors and magistrates from the South African Development Community (SADC) region. The training covered the international and Zimbabwean trafficking legal framework, jurisprudence in the SADC region, cross-border cooperation, and trafficking case studies. In December 2017, the Director Inspector of the Criminal Investigation Unit trained 20 police officers. Corruption in law enforcement and the judiciary may have impaired the effectiveness of anti-trafficking efforts. Victims reportedly refused to report or pursue cases of trafficking due to fear their traffickers could bribe police or judges. The government did not report any investigations, prosecutions, or convictions of government officials complicit in human trafficking offenses.","protection":"The government increased its efforts to identify and protect trafficking victims. The government reported identifying 87 potential trafficking victims, compared with 72 victims identified by officials in 2016. The government repatriated 14 victims, all women between the ages of 22 and 45, including 13 from Kuwait and one from South Africa. The Ministry of Labor coordinated with a local NGO to identify and refer to care 73 potential child victims of sex trafficking from high-density areas in Harare. All potential child victims received protective services including counseling, medical care, and an education needs assessment by an NGO, which had 12 shelters throughout the country. The NGO did not receive funding from the government and struggled to operate without such support. Of the potential child victims, 10 girls were taken to a vocational training center to receive skills training and 46 children were placed in children's homes. In addition, the government assisted four foreign male victims of forced labor. Furthermore, a local NGO-operated hotline received calls from 146 boys and 143 girls seeking assistance for exploitation in domestic service; many reported they were subjected to sexual, physical, and verbal abuse by their employers. One boy and 53 girls called the hotline to report their exploitation in sex trafficking. The ministry established a system whereby each potential trafficking case reported was handled jointly by an NGO and a Department of Social Welfare case worker; however, the government did not provide financial support to the NGOs. The government paid the tuition for the children of trafficking victims. In coordination with an international organization, the government coordinated a two-day training for 80 female trafficking survivors on entrepreneurship and, following the training, the government purchased equipment to assist each participant in starting livelihood projects. The government supported monitoring activities to track the women's progress. The Immigration Department also developed standard operating procedures, which provided guidance to immigration officers responding to vulnerable groups including potential trafficking victims. In 2016, the Ministry of Public Service, Labor and Social Welfare (MPSLSW) established the technical steering committee on the protection of victims of trafficking to oversee the protection and provision of re-integration assistance and referral services to victims of trafficking. The government also developed and adopted a national referral mechanism for vulnerable migrants in Zimbabwe, which included standard operating procedures to guide front-line responders in identifying potential trafficking cases. In partnership with an international organization, the government trained border and law enforcement officials, labor inspectors, social workers, and civil society organizations on victim identification and interview techniques. While the 2014 Trafficking in Persons Act required the government to establish centers in each of Zimbabwe's 10 provinces to provide counseling, rehabilitation, and reintegration services, these centers had not been established at the end of the reporting period. The government reported no victims were detained, fined, or jailed for unlawful acts committed as a result of being trafficked. ","recommendation":"Amend the 2014 anti-trafficking legislation to incorporate a definition of trafficking consistent with the 2000 UN TIP Protocol; vigorously investigate, prosecute, and convict traffickers, including complicit government officials; formalize procedures for identifying victims and referring them to the care of appropriate government or NGO service providers; provide financial or in-kind support to NGOs and international organizations that provide victim services; expand training for law enforcement on investigative techniques; train prosecutors and judges on trafficking and trafficking-related legislation; establish safe houses for trafficking victims in each province; implement, and allocate sufficient resources to, the national action plan to combat trafficking; and raise awareness of human trafficking and the availability of assistance for victims.","tier":"TIER 2 WATCH LIST","traffick_profile":"As reported over the past five years, Zimbabwe is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to sex trafficking and forced labor. Women and girls from Zimbabwean towns bordering South Africa, Mozambique, and Zambia are subjected to forced labor, including domestic servitude, and sex trafficking in brothels catering to long-distance truck drivers on both sides of the borders. Zimbabwean men, women, and children are subjected to forced labor in agriculture and domestic service in the country's rural areas, as well as domestic servitude and sex trafficking in cities and surrounding towns. Family members recruit children and other relatives from rural areas for work in cities where they are often subjected to domestic servitude or other forms of forced labor; some children, particularly orphans, are lured with promises of education or adoption. Reports indicate that adults have recruited girls for child sex trafficking in Victoria Falls. Children are subjected to forced labor in the agricultural and mining sectors and are forced to carry out illegal activities, including drug smuggling. There were increased reports of children from Mozambique being subjected to forced labor in street vending in Zimbabwe, including in Mbare. Additionally, the practice of ngozi, giving a family member to another family to avenge the spirits of a murdered relative, creates a vulnerability to trafficking.Zimbabwean women and men are lured into exploitative labor situations in agriculture, construction, information technology, and hospitality largely in neighboring countries; some subsequently become victims of forced labor, and some women become victims of forced prostitution. Women are exploited in domestic servitude, forced labor, and sex trafficking in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. There were previous reports of Zimbabwean women lured to China and the Middle East for work, where they are vulnerable to trafficking. There were reports of Zimbabwean students being lured to Cyprus with false promises for education via scholarship schemes where they are exploited in forced labor and sex trafficking. Many Zimbabwean adult and child migrants enter South Africa with the assistance of taxi drivers who transport them to the border at Beitbridge or nearby unofficial crossing locations and are subject to labor and sex trafficking. Some of the migrants are transferred to criminal gangs that subject them to abuse, including forced prostitution in Musina, Pretoria, Johannesburg, or Durban. Some Zimbabwean men, women, and children in South Africa are subjected to months of forced labor without pay, on farms, at construction sites, in factories, mines, and other businesses. Men, women, and children, predominantly from East Africa, are transported through Zimbabwe en route to South Africa; some of these migrants are trafficking victims. Refugees from Somalia and Democratic Republic of the Congo reportedly travel from Zimbabwe's Tongogara Refugee Camp to Harare, where they are exploited and, in some cases, forced into prostitution. Chinese nationals are reportedly forced to labor in restaurants in Zimbabwe. Chinese construction and mining companies in Zimbabwe reportedly employ practices indicative of forced labor, including verbal, physical, and sexual abuse, and various means of coercion to induce work in unsafe or otherwise undesirable conditions."}}
