<!-- Modeled after https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox.js/example/v1.0.0/animating-flight-paths/.
    Mapbox has a great page about using SVG/arc.js to animate flight paths, which tend to be
    curved (geodesic). Flight paths worldwide fly an arc between two points, which is why
    they are curved. Given that our data involves the movement of people throughout the world, 
    we thought it was best to use this model to display the typical flight routes commonly 
    traversed by traffickers and victims alike. 
    NOTE: While some code has been used directly, other lines have been changed to reflect our
    data and project scope. Original comments are in "". -->
